<H2>BACKGROUND</H2>
After Khyron's suicidal attack on New Macross and the Food Riots of 2015, the
United Earth Government made a concentrated effort to confiscate or destroy
all remaining Zentraedi mecha on Earth.  They hoped that a lack of mecha
combined with the Zentraedi's genetic inability to repair their own war
machines would discourage malcontent Zentraedi from attacking, or at least
weaken them enough to be easily defeated by RDF peacekeeping forces. 
Nevertheless, hundreds of Zentraedi mecha escaped the UEG's efforts and were
smuggled into the Zentraedi Control Zone in South America.  After the Brazilia
Massacre in July of 2015, bands of Malcontents used these mecha to strike back
at RDF and Southern Cross peacekeeping forces.  Still, the UEG hoped that
"Malcontent Uprisings" would come to a quick end as more and more Zentraedi
mecha were destroyed by Earth forces.
<P>
Then, in June of 2016 reports started coming in of attacks on RDF and Southern
Cross patrols by jury-rigged suits of powered armor.  Where or how these mecha
were produced were a complete mystery, with UEG "experts" blaming everyone
from E.B.S.I.S. agents to "the advance forces of the Robotech Masters."  As
the year wore on, the number and deadliness of these mecha (named "Stingers"
by RDF Intelligence) increased at an alarming rate, until by December of that
year they posed a clear and dangerous threat to all RDF forces in the region.
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=252 HEIGHT=208 SRC="./Images/stinger2.gif">
An intensive undercover search by RDF Intelligence eventually revealed that
the primary source of Stingers was a Malcontent band called the Scavengers. 
The Scavengers constantly confounded the experts in Zentraedi psychology and
military tactics by devoting nearly all their efforts to constructing mecha (a
feat which up till now was considered impossible for Zentraedi) rather than
combat which was the Zentraedi imperative.  Apparently, the hardships of life
in the South American jungles had somehow reawakened the Scavengers' natural
inventiveness, which had been suppressed long ago by the Robotech Masters. 
Over the course of the Uprisings the Scavengers built almost 2,000 Stingers
for other Malcontent bands, as well as developed other weapons of destruction
for Zentraedi.  Two other well-known weapons produced by the Scavengers was an
atomic bomb used to destroy the Southlands city Oasis, killing approximately
53,000 people, and a robotic insect with an insanity-producing chemical weapon
that almost destroyed Cavern City, the largest city and RDF base in South
America.  The Scavengers were eventually destroyed in August of 2018 by a
combined RDF/Southern Cross/Loyal Zentraedi strike on their base of
operations.  This became known as the last major battle of the Uprisings, as
without support from the Scavengers most of the other Malcontent bands quickly
collapsed.  No other examples of Zentraedi developing inventiveness were ever
discovered on Earth.  The few remaining RDF-Zentraedi forces finally
rediscovered their inventiveness during the REF's mission to Tirol, where they
were stationed on Fantoma's surface to mine monopole ore for the SDF-3.
<P>
No two Stingers look exactly alike.  All Stingers are constructed from the
remains of RDF and/or Zentraedi mecha, sometimes almost without rhyme or
reason.  However, all Stingers do have some qualities in common.  They are all
roughly humanoid shaped, with two arms, two legs, a head and a main body.  All
Stingers are capable of flight, with thrusters mounted in a backpack-like
assembly on the back of the mecha.  Almost all Stinger weapons are mated
directly to the mecha's body.  It is extremely uncommon to see a Stinger with
a hand-held weapon, even though most of them are equipped with hands or
grasping units (the hands are usually used for grasping supplies during
raids).
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=252 HEIGHT=280 VSPACE=3 SRC="./Images/stinger3.gif">
Almost all Stingers are located in South America, specifically in the
Zentraedi Control Zone.  From there they launch hit-and-run attacks against
RDF bases and transports.  They also stage "harassing" attacks on any RDF
forces that enter the Zone.  Stingers never attack alone; they will always be
found in groups of no less than four.  Large groups of Stingers are also
uncommon, unless they are defending a Malcontent base or Stinger production
facility.  Stinger pilots know that their mecha are no match for RDF mecha in
a straight fight, so they will always use terrain and cover to maximum effect.
 Stingers are quickly proving to be a major problem for RDF and Southern Cross
peacekeeping forces.  The location and destruction of all Stinger production
facilities is of maximum importance to all UEG forces in the region.
<P>
Due to the mandatory micronization of Zentraedi living on Earth, the
Scavengers intentionally scaled the Stingers for use by micronized Zentraedi. 
This also made them very popular to Black Marketeers, who continued to support
a few of them after the fall of the Scavengers.  The last known sighting of a
Stinger was two years after the end of the Second Robotech War, when a
combined E.B.S.I.S./Zentraedi force tried to steal protoculture from an
understaffed Southern Cross base in Mexico.  It is unknown but highly doubtful
that any Stingers survived the Invid Wars and still exist on Earth.

<LI><B>MAIN AND AUXILIARY WEAPONS.</B>  Since Stingers are built entirely from
salvaged mecha, their armament is extremely variable.  To determine a
Stinger's armament, roll 2D8 to determine the number of weapon systems the
Stinger is equipped with.  Then for each system roll 2D6 and consult the table
below to determine the actual weapon.  Stinger weapons may be located anywhere
on the mecha, but are usually built into the arms and shoulders of the unit. 
All reference pages refer to pages in the original Robotech RPG book.  Note
that some systems require two spaces due to their size.

<UL>
<LI><B>RADAR:</B> 200 mile (321 km) range.  The radar is located in the 
  nose/head of the mecha and will be destroyed if the head is destroyed.
<LI><B>RADIO COMMUNICATION:</B> Long range, directional communications 
  system with satellite relay capabilities.  Range: 600 miles (960 km) or can 
  be boosted indefinitely via satellite relay.
<LI><B>LOUDSPEAKER:</B> A loudspeaker system is built into the mecha, which   
  can be used to amplify the pilot's voice up to 90 decibels.
</UL>
<H3>ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT:</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Roll 2D6 three times on the following table to determine additional systems
the Stinger is equipped with.  If a particular system is rolled twice, re-roll
until three unique systems are choses.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<OL START=2>
<LI><B>COMBAT COMPUTER:</B> The Stinger is equipped with a combat computer 
  that can store and analyze data during combat with hostile forces.  The 
  combat computer tracks and identifies specific enemy targets, and has a 
  database of over 200 images stored in memory.  The computer can identify and
  track up to 20 targets simultaneously.  The computer provides an additional
  +1 to hit and +1 to dodge in addition to the bonuses listed below.
<LI><B>ESCAPE POD:</B> The entire cockpit of the Stinger is a detachable 
  escape pod that can be jettisoned when the mecha is destroyed.  The pod is 
  NOT equipped with thrusters, but is equipped with a parachute to provide a 
  soft landing in case of ejection in an atmosphere.  The pilot of the Stinger
  must manually trigger the cockpit ejection sequence when his craft is 
  destroyed.  The pod is NOT automatically ejected when the main body MDC 
  reaches zero.
<LI><B>HOMING SIGNAL:</B> The Stinger is equipped with a homing device that 
  allows other Stingers who know the broadcast frequency of the beacon to 
  locate and track the craft.  The range of the signal is 50 miles (80 km).
<LI><B>OPTICS: THERMAL IMAGER:</B> Range: 2000 feet (610 m).  A passive 
  optical heat sensor that detects infrared radiation projected by warm 
  objects and converts that data into a false-color visible image.  The system
  enables the pilot to see in the dark, in shadows, and through smoke, and 
  also adds a +10% bonus to pilots using a tracking skill.
<LI><B>OPTICS: INFRARED:</B> Range: 2000 feet (610 m).  This optical system 
  projects a beam of infrared light that is invisible to the normal eye, but 
  detectable by the mecha's sensors.  The system allows the pilot to detect 
  hidden/concealed objects by their IR reflectiveness.  The beam will be 
  visible to anyone with IR sensitive optics, however.
<LI><B>OPTICS: NIGHT VISION:</B> Range: 2000 feet (610 m).  A passive light 
  image intensifier that emits no light of its own, but relies on ambient 
  light which is electronically amplified to produce a visible picture.
<LI><B>EXTERNAL AUDIO PICKUP:</B> Range: 300 ft (91.5 m).  A sound 
  amplification system that can pick up normal conversation up to 300 feet 
  away.
<LI><B>SELF-DESTRUCT:</B> To prevent capture of the Stinger by enemy forces, 
  the pilot can activate the mecha's self-destruct system, which will cause 
  the fighter to explode after a delay of up to 60 minutes (time is set by the
  pilot).  The explosive damage is contained within a 100 foot (30 m) area and
  inflicts 2D6x10 M.D. to everything within the radius of the explosion.  The 
  Stinger will be totally obliterated by the explosion.  Note that Zentraedi 
  pilots are very fond of crashing Stingers into bases or mecha and activating
  the self-destruct in an attempt to take out enemies with them when escape is
  impossible.
<LI><B>HEAT AND RADIATION SHIELDS:</B> Special shielding prevents the 
  penetration of life threatening heat and radiation.  A radiation detection 
  and alarm system are linked with the shields and will sound an alarm if 
  there is a rupture in the shields and what the levels of radiation are.
<LI><B>TACTICAL LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEM:</B> The Stinger's cockpit is pressurized,
  and also provides additional air feeds to the pilot's flight suit that 
  provides him with pressurized breathing.
<LI><B>LASER TARGETING SYSTEM:</B> Range: 50 miles (80 km).  Used for 
  increased accuracy in the striking of enemy targets.  Provides a +2 bonus to
  hit in addition to the below bonuses.
