<IMG SRC="Images/gundam.gif" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="465">
When the Jion Archduchy separated from the Earth Federation in UC 
(Universal Century) 0054, the Jion military leaders knew that an 
eventual war with the Federation was inevitable.  They also knew that 
their small space navy had no hope of winning against the superior 
Federation forces, so they instructed the Jion scientists to begin 
development of a new type of weapon that would be small enough to be 
cheaply and quickly produced, but powerful enough to give the Jion 
forces an advantage over their Federation counterparts.
<P>
The first major triumph for the Jion scientists was the discovery of the 
<I>Minovski Particles</I>.  These particles generate an unstable magnetic 
field that absorbs most forms of energy instead of reflecting it.  
Although they have a fairly short life span, the Minovski particles had 
two major benefits.  The first was that by scattering them in space, the 
Jions could create combat areas where all radio and radar based systems 
were effectively useless.  This dramatically changed the rules of space 
combat, forcing spacecraft to rely on visual sensors only.
<P>
The second major application of Minovski Particles was in the creation 
of a new form radiation shielding, which was very thin and light yet 
hundreds of times stronger than lead for containing radiation.  This new 
shielding allowed the creation of extremely small, very powerful 
reactors.  The Jion engineers used these new systems to their maximum 
potential, creating a completely new form of one-man fighter craft, the 
<I>"Mobile Suit"</I>.  This 60-foot tall humanoid robot soldier was extremely 
fast and could stop and turn on a dime.  They could also be equipped 
with weapons that were just as powerful as spaceship cannons.  Although 
they were not heavily armored, the combination of speed and firepower 
made them ideal for combat in Minovski-jammed areas.  The first combat-
ready mobile suit, the <B>MS-05 Zaku</B>, was rolled out in UC 0075.  A much
improved model, the <B>MS-06 Zaku II</B>, began production in UC 0078.
<P>
Initially, the Federation generals viewed the idea of 60 foot tall 
fighting robots as idiotic at best, but they quickly changed their minds 
when the Jion Archduchy declared war on the Earth Federation in early 
0079.  Within three weeks, Jion forces heavily supported by the new 
Zakus destroyed 80% of the Federation space navy.  Jion troops then 
invaded Earth and succeeded in capturing North America, Central America, 
and large regions of Europe and Asia.  Within one month of the Jion 
Archduchy's declaration of war, defeat seemed inevitable for the 
Federation forces.
<P>
The Federation quickly began "Project Victory," an operation whose sole 
purpose was to produce a superior mobile suit design for Federation 
forces.  This project culminated with the construction of the <B>RX-78 
Gundam</B>, a general-purpose mobile suit that was far superior to the 
Jion's MS-06 Zaku.  The Gundam was equipped with the best technology the 
Federation could offer.  It was designed around the revolutionary "Core 
Block" system, a modular system that allowed for quick maintenance and 
replacement of the Gundam's systems.  The Gundam's armor was constructed 
of Lunar Titanium, a new metal that was extremely strong but also very 
light.  While incapable of withstanding hits from a mega particle beam, 
Lunar Titanium could handle direct hits from the Zaku's 120mm autocannon.
Finally, the Gundam was armed with a beam rifle and two beam sabers, which 
were the most destructive mobile suit weapons yet produced.
<P>
Three Gundam prototypes were constructed, but two of them (#1 and #3) 
were destroyed before they ever saw combat.  The #2 prototype survived 
and was piloted by Ensign Amuro Rey throughout the war.  The Jions 
responded to Project Victory by developing their own advanced mobile 
suits.  Some, like the <B>MS-14 Geloog</B>, were technically more powerful than 
the Gundam.  However, Amuro Rey's emerging "New Type" powers allowed him 
to pilot the Gundam with incredible skill, enabling him to defeat 
anything the Jion forces threw at him.  Eventually, the Federation 
engineers succeeded in developing a mass production version of the 
Gundam (the <B>RGM-79 "GM"</B>) and the tide of battle turned in favor of the 
Federation forces.  The Federation succeeded in driving the Jion forces 
off of Earth, and eventually the Jion Archduchy collapsed after its 
ruling family, the Zabi, were killed in the "Battle of Abowaku".  The
Federation negotiated a peace treaty with the post-Zabi Jion Republic
in early UC 0080, thus ending the One Year War.
<P>
The RX-78 Gundam prototype #2 was destroyed in the Battle of Abowaku.  A 
fourth prototype, the <B>RX-78NT1 "Alex"</B> was constructed especially for 
Amuro Rey in late UC 0079.  However, the new Gundam could not be 
delivered to him in time for the Battle of Abowaku, and the "Alex" was 
destroyed by Jion forces a week before the war ended.  The Gundam and GM 
mobile suits became the symbol of Federation military power after the 
end of the war.

<OL>
<LI><B>HEAD-MOUNTED 60mm VULCAN CANNONS:</B>
   The only built-in armaments on the RX-78 Gundam are two vulcan cannons 
   mounted in the head of the mobile suit.  These two cannons are mounted 
   on either side of the antenna and are fixed forward.  The pilot must 
   move the Gundam's head in order to aim the cannons.  Both cannons fire 
   at the same time, though one cannon will function if the other is destroyed.
   <P><UL>
   <LI><B>Primary Purpose:</B> Defense
   <LI><B>Secondary Purpose:</B> Close-range Assault
   <LI><B>Mega-Damage:</B> 1D6x10 M.D. per burst (60 rounds from both cannons).  
       A single round does 1D6 M.D. 
   <LI><B>Range:</B> 3000ft (900m)
   <LI><B>Rate of Fire:</B> Equal to the pilot's combined number of attacks.
   <LI><B>Payload:</B> 600 rounds per cannon, which is enough for 20 combined
            bursts.  Note: The ammo bins for the two cannons are NOT 
            linked; if one cannon is destroyed the ammo feed CANNOT be
            automatically switched to the other cannon.
   </UL><P>
<LI><B>1.9 MW BEAM RIFLE:</B> This hand-held particle cannon is the main weapon 
   for the RX-78 Gundam, and is easily as powerful as the main cannons 
   mounted on Federation or Jion warships.  It works by confining and 
   accelerating mega particles in a strong magnetic field, and then ejects 
   them in a tremendous blast of energy.  Mega particles are produced when 
   Minovski particles go through a degeneration and fusion process.  
   Warships normally hook their beam cannons up to generators that can 
   produce mega particles on the fly, thus resulting in an almost unlimited 
   supply of ammo.  Since the Gundam does not have room for the bulky 
   generator equipment, the mega particles are instead pre-generated and 
   stored in an energy capacitor for later use.  The result is an MS-sized gun 
   that packs the same punch as warship weapons but has a limited ammo supply.
   <P>
   The original beam rifle for the RX-78 Gundam had the energy capacitor 
   built directly into the gun, which meant that it could only be recharged
   at a base or ship and couldn't be exchanged in the field.  Later models
   of the beam rifle included a modular capacitor that could be exchanged
   in the field (much like an energy clip).  These modified rifles did not
   become widely spread until 0082-0083, however.
   <P>
   One Beam Rifle is usually assigned to the Gundam, though a second one 
   can be stored on the inside of the shield if necessary.
   <P><UL>
   <LI><B>Primary Purpose:</B> Assault
   <LI><B>Mega-Damage:</B> 4D6x10 M.D. per blast.  Bursts are not possible.
   <LI><B>Range:</B> 6000ft (1800m)
   <LI><B>Rate of Fire:</B> Maximum of 3 shots per melee round.
   <LI><B>Payload:</B> 20 shots maximum.  The rifle must be recharged at a base or
            mothership after it is depleted.  It CANNOT be replaced in 
            the middle of a battle.
   </UL><P>
   <B>NOTE:</B> The first versions of this weapon had technical problems that 
   caused it to malfunction with extended use.  After the first shot, 
   roll a 1d10 every time the weapon is fired.  On a roll of 1 the gun 
   malfunctions and cannot be fired again until serviced by technicians.  
   These design flaws were finally corrected shortly before the Battle
   of Abowaku.
   <P>
<LI><B>0.38 MW BEAM SABERS:</B>  These revolutionary mecha-sized melee weapon 
   were first used on the Gundam mobile suit.  The beam saber works on 
   the same principle as the beam rifle, except that the mega particles 
   are captured and stored in a strong electromagnetic field instead 
   of projected in a beam.  The result is a concentrated energy blade   
   which is one of the deadliest weapons in the Gundam universe.
   <P>
   The beam saber only contains enough energy and mega particles for 
   about 60 seconds of continuous use.  When not in use, the beam sabers are 
   stored in the backpack of the mecha, where they are recharged by the 
   Gundam's reactor.  The Gundam can switch the beam saber on and off while 
   holding it, in order to conserve power.  Once totally depleted it takes 30 
   minutes for a beam saber to recharge to full capacity.
   <P>
   The Gundam carries two beam sabers mounted on its backpack.  An 
   additional two sabers (fully charged) can be stored on the inside of the
   shield.
   <P><UL>
   <LI><B>Primary Purpose:</B> Melee Combat
   <LI><B>Secondary Purpose:</B> Defense
   <LI><B>Mega-Damage:</B> 5d6x10 M.D.
   <LI><B>Range:</B> The blade has a range of 15-30 ft (5-10 m) and is adjustable.
   <LI><B>Payload:</B> The beam sabers can function continuously for 60 seconds
            (4 melee rounds) before running out of power).  Once discharged, 
            the beam saber must be returned to the Gundam's backpack where it 
            can recharge at a rate of 1 second of power per 30 seconds of 
            charging.
   </UL><P>
<LI><B>270 mm HYPERBAZOOKA:</B>  This optional weapon is essentially an 
   enormous rocket launcher for the mobile suit.  It fires large UNGUIDED 
   chemically-propelled rockets with high explosive warheads.  These 
   missiles are unguided because Minovski particle jamming renders most 
   forms of tracking systems useless in the Gundam universe.  Therefore 
   the designers decided to remove the tracking systems in the rockets
   and replace them with more powerful explosives.
   <P>
   ONE hyperbazooka can be mounted on the back of the Gundam.  Due to 
   its bulk and low payload, this weapons is usually reserved for 
   missions involving heavy assault.

   <LI><B>Primary Purpose:</B> Assault
   <LI><B>Mega-Damage:</B> 3d6x10 M.D. per missile.

   <LI><B>Range:</B> 5 miles (8 km).
   </UL><P>
<LI><B>OPTIONAL HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT:</B> Punch does 3D6 M.D., Body Block does 
   3D6 M.D., Kick does 4D6 M.D., Leap Kick does 5D6 M.D., Stomp does
   3D6 M.D., but is limited to targets no more than 16 feet tall.  Body 
   flip does 2D6 M.D.  Pilots who have experience with giant robots get
   full bonuses from Robot Basic combat training.

<H3>STANDARD EQUIPMENT FOR MOST MOBILE SUITS</H3>
<UL>
<LI><B>OPTICAL TARGETING SYSTEM:</B> Mobile Suits have very sophisticated 
  optical tracking systems to assist the pilot in targeting.  This 
  system provides the pilot with a +2 to hit when using projectile or 
  beam weapons (such as the beam rifle, hyperbazooka, or vulcan cannons 
  on the Gundam).  However, since the tracking system is optical, the 
  target must be IN DIRECT LINE OF SIGHT from the MS in order to get 
  the bonus.
<LI><B>COMBAT COMPUTER:</B> Contains data on up to 120 different vehicles (both 
  friend and foe).  Can call up and project data on the HUD screens in 
  the cockpit.
<LI><B>"SKIN TOUCH" COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM:</B> Mobile Suits have sensitive 
  microphones in their cockpits that can pick up a pilot's voice and 
  project it to vibrating devices on the surface of the hand.  By 
  grasping hands with another Mobile Suit, the first mecha can transmit 
  these vibrations to the other mecha.  Sensors on the other mecha 
  translate these vibrations into sounds and projects them via speakers 
  in the cockpit.  The result is a secure method of communication 
  between mecha that cannot be intercepted by enemy scanners.
<LI><B>LASER COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM:</B> Although the original Gundam prototype 
  did not have this system, later mobile suits included a laser 
  communications system that allowed mecha to communicate over long 
  distances.  The only disadvantage was that the mobile suits had to be 
  looking at each other in order to communicate.
<LI><B>RADIO COMMUNICATIONS:</B> Backup; usually doesn't work due to Minovski 
  interference.
<LI><B>EXPLOSIVE JOINTS:</B> In event of severe damage to the Gundam, the torso
  sections could be jettisoned allowing the pilot to escape in the core

<H2><A NAME="coreblock">SPECIAL GUNDAM EQUIPMENT:<BR>THE CORE BLOCK SYSTEM</A></H2>
The core block system was a revolutionary way of designing mobile suits, 
first implemented on the Gundam MS.  The idea was to include the combat 
computer and cockpit of the mecha (and the pilot; the three most valuable
parts) in a central modular unit that could be ejected and recovered if 
the mobile suit was ever destroyed.  (NOTE: later core fighters designed in 
0083 also contained the mecha's reactor)  The core unit would be modular, 
so that it could be transferred to another mobile suit body while the 
original one was being repaired (thus reducing down-time for pilots).  The 
modular aspects of the core block system would also allow the mobile suit to 
be customized to different environments and equipped with special weaponry 
for unusual missions.
<P>
The designers of the Gundam then took this concept one step further, and 
designed the central unit so that it could transform into a fully 
functional plane when not attached to a Gundam body.  This would allow 
the pilot to escape with the most valuable systems of the mecha in case 
the Gundam ever got destroyed in battle.  Although some designers 
envisioned using the <B>"Core Fighter"</B> as a combat fighter, it proved to 
be rather ill-suited for that role.  The Core Fighter is too slow to be 
an effective combat aircraft, and its armaments are too light to do serious
damage to most mobile suits.  Later on during the war an external unit 
(called the "Core Booster") was developed, which could be attached to the 
Core Fighter and turn it into a fairly powerful heavy fighter.
<P>
The Core Block system benefited the Gundam several times during the war.  
However, the system proved too expensive to include in all Federation 
mecha, and was therefore not included in later mass-production versions 
of the Gundam.  Eventually the Core Block System was scrapped in favor 
of the Linear Seat System; a virtual environment display system that 
provided much more visual information for the pilot of the mecha.

<H2>GM NOTES FOR <I>RIFTS</I> GAMES</H2>
The RX-78 Gundam probably isn't powerful enough to be of very much interest 
to Rifts characters.  Although fairly agile for its size, the mecha is too 
big for the guerilla-style combat that is most common on Rifts earth.  The 
armor is also fairly weak when compared to other Rifts mecha, though Northern 
Gun or Triax may be able to come up with something that could replace it.  
The damage capacity of the mecha is respectable, but even so the players 
probably won't want to run around with a 60 ft tall mecha that sticks out 
like a sore thumb on the landscape.
<P>
The only possible interest the Gundam might have is in the Minovski 
technology it contains.  Rifts technology does contains systems that are 
equal to or superior to the Gundam's capabilities, but the technology in the 
RX-78 eventually becomes the basis for smaller, faster, and DEADLIER mecha in 
the Gundam continuity.  Such mecha can be seen in shows like <B>Gundam: Char's 
Counterattack</B>, <B>Gundam F91</B>, and <B>Victory Gundam</B>.  Extended 
research into Minovski physics by Rifts engineers may eventually produce 
designs that are just as powerful.

...to <B>MARK SIMMONS</B> (also an original <I>Animag</I> staff member), whose 
extensive comments and corrections resulted in a much better representation 
of the official RX-78 Gundam, now complete with Bandai's continuity changes. :-)
<P>
<H2>A NOTE TO PURISTS</H2>
I didn't have time to rewatch the three Gundam movies again, so you'll 
have to forgive me if there's something in the original show that my 
stats don't reflect.  I am very much open to comments and corrections, 
however, so if you know something I don't please contact me and I'll fix 
the problem.  Thanks!
<P>
