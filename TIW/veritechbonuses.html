<H1>VERITECH COMBAT BONUSES</H1>
<IMG SRC="./Images/liberty.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=288 HEIGHT=216 BORDER=2>
When the Robotech Expeditionary Force (REF) redesigned the Veritech they
standardized and improved the cockpit design of the new fighters.
The 67 various controls in the old VF-1 Veritech cockpit have been combined
into several pilot-configurable monitor displays and a HOTAS (hands-on
throttle and stick) control system to reduce the difficulty in controlling the
aircraft.  This design paradigm continued when newer Alphas and Betas were
developed, which greatly reduced the time necessary to train Veritech pilots to
fly the new designs.  As a result, pilots trained in one particular type of 
Alpha or Beta fighter can fly all Alphas/Betas with no appreciable difficulty.
<P>
In order to fly an Alpha or Beta the character must have the <B>Pilot REF
Veritechs</B> skill.  In addition if the pilot plans to engage in combat with
his veritech then he must select a combat training skill based on which VF he
plans to fly.  There are four skills for REF Veritech combat training,
<B>Alpha Fighter Combat Training</B>, <B>Alpha Fighter Combat BASIC
Training</B>, <B>Beta Fighter Combat Training</B>, and <B>Beta Fighter Combat
BASIC Training</B>.  Because of the similarities in design and cockpit
controls for all REF Veritechs, anyone with Alpha training can pilot the
VAF-6, VAF-7, VAF-8, and VAF-9 series Alphas equally well, and likewise pilots
with Beta training are qualified on VBF-1, VBF-2, and VBF-3 series Betas. 
There is no penalty for switching between designs.  The only exception to this
rule is the <B>VF-1V Vindicator</B>.  The Vindicator was a technical design
experiment based heavily on the VF-1 series veritechs, and as such the cockpit
design for the Vindicator is more reminiscent of the VF-1 series cockpits than
the new Alphas.  In order to get full combat bonuses for the Vindicator pilots
must have either <B>Vindicator Combat Training</B> or <B>VF-1 Veritech
Combat</B> Training.  Characters with Alpha or Beta Combat Training get only
basic bonuses when flying the Vindicator.
<P>
In order to determine the bonuses a character gets from Alpha or Beta
training, consult the tables below.  The first lists general bonuses that a
character earns from a specific training skill regardless of which Alpha/Beta
model he is piloting.  Then look at the second table to get a list of the
specific bonuses associated with the model of Veritech the character is
piloting.  All skills and bonuses for Alphas and Betas are exclusive; a
character can have Alpha Combat <I>or</I> Alpha Basic training, but not both
skills to try and combine bonuses.  A character can have both Alpha and Beta
combat training if he plans to be flying both types of veritechs.
<P>
Remember, these bonuses are in addition to the pilot's own hand to hand
training and attribute bonuses, but apply ONLY when piloting a veritech. 
These mecha combat bonuses do not apply to the pilot's physical abilities when
outside the mecha.
<P>
<B>NOTE:</B> Changing modes between fighter, guardian, and battloid counts as
one attack/action for a melee round.
