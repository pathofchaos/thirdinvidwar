NEW INVID NPCs, BASES,<BR>SPACECRAFT, AND EQUIPMENT</H1>
<P>
As the Third Invid War dragged on, it became clear to resistance fighters 
that the new Invid forces occupying Earth were definitely <B>NOT</B> the 
same as those that had invaded it during the Second Invid War.  At first 
the Invid used the same mecha designs and tactics as the Regis did, but
eventually new designs started appearing along with new, innovative strategies
that took the rebels by surprise.  It was almost as if whoever was leading
these new invaders was becoming more imaginative (and more deadly) as time
went on.
<P>
The first divergence from typical Invid strategy appeared in 2041, when 
new lights were noticed in the night sky by the resistance.  Later 
reconnaissance revealed that these lights were in fact powerful orbiting
<A HREF="./spacehive.html"><B>Space Hives</B></A>, 
heavily armed and armored, and designed specifically for 
anti-spacecraft warfare.  Apparently the Invid had learned from their 
defeat at the <I>Battle of Reflex Point</I> in the Second Invid War, and
were trying to make sure that the Earth was isolated from REF fleets returning
from Tirol.  Then, in 2043 as the Invid Space Hives were nearing completion, 
the first <A HREF="./newinvidmecha.html">new Invid mecha designs</A> began to 
appear on Earth.  This took the resistance completely by surprise, and many 
rebels were lost while trying to adjust to the deadlier mecha.
<P>

Changes were also becoming apparent in the Invid's behaviour towards humanity.
Before 2043, the Invid mostly ignored the civilian population of Earth.  So
long as terrans did not take up arms and attack the Invid, they were content
to leave them alone.  In early 2044 some Invid began actively recruiting 
gangs of dissident humans to work for them.  These invid sympathizers, called
<A HREF="./frags.html"><B>FRAGS</B></A>, were used to pacify towns and 
hunt down rebels, and generally supplement the forces of the Invid in areas
of lower value.  The Invid also started stepping up their attacks against
the resistance during this time, conducting organized sweeps and strikes 
against towns suspected of housing or aiding resistance fighters, as well
as attacking small towns to try and draw the resistance out of hiding.
<P>
However, even these increases in savagery by the new Invid paled compared to
what was to come.  In 2045 (known as the start of <B>"The Dark Years"</B>)
the Invid began rounding up civilians from surrounding towns and herding them
into massive <B>Slave Camps</B>, where they were forced to harvest massive
amounts of the Flower of Life for shipment to places unknown (to the humans).
After harvest, the flower was stored on huge <A HREF="./cargotransport.html">
<B>Cargo Transports</B></A>, which then took off from the farms and headed
into Earth orbit.
<P>
These changes led to a decrease in morale among terran resistance, as more 
and more people died and the Invid continued to gain power despite their
best efforts.  Unless something was done soon, there would be no hope left
for those fighting for freedom during the <I>Third Invid War</I>...
