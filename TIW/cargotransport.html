<H1>THE INVID CARGO TRANSPORT</H1>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=456 HEIGHT=376 BORDER=2 SRC="./Images/cargotransport.gif">
<BR CLEAR=LEFT><P>
<H2>BACKGROUND</H2>
The Invid Cargo Transport is a new Invid starship designed to transport
harvested flowers and protoculture from Earth to the Regis' new base of
operations in an undisclosed system.  Stylistically, it somewhat
resembles the Invid Troop Carrier ("Clam Ship").  However, there are a
number of differences.  The basic shape of the Cargo Transport is a
large flat oval with rounded edges.  Six large thrusters and six
antigravity domes are located on the back of one of the short edges, and
look very similar to those of the Troop Transport.  Unlike the Troop
Transport, the Cargo Transport can NOT open up like a clam.  This is not
a design flaw; the Cargo Transport was never intended to carry troops or
engage in combat.
<P>
The Cargo Transport is large and mostly hollow inside.  The only
compartmentalized area on the ship is near the rear, where the bridge
and engines are located.  The interior of the front of the ship is
largely filled with frameworks and scaffolding, which hold hundreds of
large containers, all carrying Protoculture or the Flower of Life.
Any mecha larger than an Invid Trooper (16.6 ft high by 13 ft
wide) will have a lot of trouble moving around inside the Transport.
This includes all forms of Veritechs and Destroids.  Anything smaller
than a Trooper (e.g. a Cyclone) will have no problem hiding among all
the containers, provided that their protoculture emissions don't give
them away.

<DL>
<DT>*
<DD> Each Antigravity Dome destroyed will reduce speed by 5%.
    Destruction of all AG Domes will restrict the transport to forward
    motion only.
<DT>**
<DD> Each main thruster destroyed will reduce speed by 10%.
<DT>***
<DD> Depleting the MDC of the power core will instantly cause an
    explosion that will totally destroy the spacecraft, along with
    anything and everything in it.
<DT>****
<DD> Depleting the MDC of the cargo section will fatally wound the
    spacecraft.  In an atmosphere, the ship will collapse in on itself
    like a punctured blimp, and in outer space the hull will simply
    burst apart at the seams.  The entire craft will explode in 1D6
    melee rounds.
<DT>*****
<DD> Depleting the MDC of the engineering section will instantly cause
    an explosion that will totally destroy the spacecraft, along with
    anything and everything in it.

<H3>SPECIFICATIONS</H3>
<DL>
<DT><B>Flight Speed:</B>
<DD> Stationary hover to Mach 5.  Has full transatmospheric
    capabilities.  Cruising speed is about Mach 1.
<DT><B>Space Fold:</B>
<DD> A hyperspace system that catapults the vessel through space
    and time.  The space fold system is used for traveling from
    one system to another quickly.  Range:  Unknown, presumably
    limitless.  Note :  When a Cargo Transport makes a space
    fold, it will also transport all vessels within one mile.

<H3>WEAPON SYSTEMS</H3>
  <B>NONE</B>.  However, Cargo Transports are usually escorted by 2-4 fully
  loaded Invid Troop Carriers.  These carriers will actually accompany the
  Cargo Transport on its voyage to New Optera and back.  Cargo Transports
  will never stray too far out of the range of the 
  <A HREF="./spacehive.html">Invid Space Hives'</A> main
  cannons, for fear of attack from REF starships.
