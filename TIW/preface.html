<B>Hello!</B>  Welcome to <B>THIRD INVID WAR</B>, one of the first 
completely web-based fan supplements for an RPG.  TIW is written by
<A HREF="./index.html"><I>Dave Deitrich</I></A> and 
<A HREF="http://www.eyrie.org/~robotech/index.html"><I>Chris Meadows
</I></A>, with artwork done by <I>Amy Borden</I> and <I>Jason Juta</I>.  I 
emphasize that this a <B>"fan supplement"</B> because this project is strictly
<B>not-for-profit</B> and is not intended to be a professional supplement in 
any way, shape or form. (so hopefully Kevin Siembieda won't decide to sue me
over it ^_^ )
<P>
<B>TIW</B> is my attempt to write a satisfactory (IMHO) conclusion to the 
"Return of the Invid" storyline started by Kevin Siembieda in his RPG.  In 
<I>Invid Invasion</I>, Siembieda says that the Invid return to Earth 6 months 
after the final Battle of Reflex Point with a much smaller force, presumably 
to harvest more protoculture for the Regis.  Although this background was 
expanded slightly in <I>Return of the Masters</I> and <I>Lancer's Rockers</I>,

there wasn't much to differentiate it from the old <I>New Generation</I> saga.
There were no new mecha, no new battle tactics, no plot development; just the
same old Invid back to provide targets for the players to shoot at.  And 
worst of all, the story was left completely open-ended with no hints of
where to go or how to resolve it.
<P>
Several years ago Chris and I came up with some ideas for new Robotech RPG
adventures that would take place several years after the Invid had left 
Earth for good.  But in order to fit our stuff into Palladium's chronology,
we had to first finish what they started.  At first we wrote a pretty 
quick (and unsatisfying) wrap-up that really wasn't much better than what 
Palladium had already done.  Not satisfied with that, I started to think 
about how we could expand on the events in the already-existing RPG 
supplements, adding in our own stuff here and there to turn what was 
originally a cheap solution into a decent sequel to the <I>New Generation</I>
chapter of Robotech.
<P>
Things started to gain momentum from there, to the point where I've been 
working more on this Invid sequel than the stories I dreamed of years ago!  
I think the final product is well worth it, though.  <B>THIRD INVID WAR</B> 
is a story of human courage and tenacity in the darkest years of the Invid
Wars, when it looks like the Invid are only a step away from winning 
everything.  Mysterious new Invid mecha, powerful orbiting hives, and devious
tactics by new Invid leaders have turned the tide of battle against the human
resistance.  The REF at Tirol has tried to help by sending more weapons, 
mecha, and personnel to Earth, but due to the Invid blockade few supplies
actually manage to make it to their destinations.  Unless things change soon,
the Invid will win the war before long.

<P>
<B>THIRD INVID WAR</B> is fully compatible with the <I>Robotech RPG</I> 
(and by extension most other Palladium games).  It contains additional 
source material for the Invid Invasion scenario starting from the return of 
the Invid after the Battle for Reflex Point, up to and including the final 
climactic battles between the people of Earth and the Invid race.  Please 
feel free to use and distribute these documents as you see fit.  All we ask
is that you don't claim this material as your own work.  For more information
please feel free to contact me at

I would love to hear any comments you have on this work!
