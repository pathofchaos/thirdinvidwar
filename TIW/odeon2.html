<H1>THE ODEON MARK II<BR>
HEAVY COMBAT INORGANIC</H1>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<IMG WIDTH=350 HEIGHT=470 SRC="./Images/odeon2.gif">
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H2>BACKGROUND</H2>
One of the earliest goals of the Stage 6 Invid in their weapons research and
experiments was to find a way to supplement their limited combat forces.  It
is therefore no surprise that one of the first new generation Inorganic
designs perfected was the <B>Odeon Mark II</B> (or <B>Brawler</B>) <B>Heavy
Combat Inorganic</B>, designed and built to fight alongside the <A
HREF="./combattrooper.html"><B>Combat Trooper</B></A> as the Invid's first
line of offense/defense.  The name "Odeon 2" is actually a misnomer given to
the inorganic by a young REF Intelligence Agent who was among the first
resistance fighters to spot the new design.  Although the Odeon 2 does bear a
moderate resemblance to its distant cousin from the Regent's forces, the
Brawler (as it is also called) is a completely different design with no
relationship between the two mecha.
<P>
The Odeon Mk. II is an enormous inorganic, standing over 41 feet (12.5 meters)
tall and equal in size to even the massive new VBF-3 Beta Fighters.  The
mecha's body is designed to intimidate and frighten an opponent as it slowly
and unstoppably advances across the battlefield towards its target.  The Odeon
2 is also equipped with a jet thruster backpack, which allows it to fly at
moderate speeds and thus keep up with Combat Troopers and other Invid mecha. 
Like the old Odeon, the amount of damage the Odeon 2 can endure is truly
staggering.  In addition to its great strength and devastating hand-to-hand
attacks, the Odeon 2 is also equipped with a number of distance attack weapon
systems.  The main weapons of the inorganic are two lance-like laser cannons
mounted on the arms of the mecha, which can be used to strafe targets from a
distance as well as slice through enemy fortifications.  In addition, some
Odeon 2s are armed with an external missile launcher that holds 4
heavy-warhead missiles, ideal for smashing through fortifications and knocking
out enemy defenses.  The launcher does have a disadvantage in that the
missiles can be detonated prematurely if resistance fighters can get close
enough to shoot them before they are fired, however.  Finally, the Odeon 2 is
armed with a devastating plasma cannon on its left breast, which vaguely
resembles the old plasma generators seen on EBSIS Battloids during the period
of the Second Robotech War.  The napalm-like plasma streams fired from this
weapon stick to targets hit by the Odeon 2 and continue to do damage until the
plasma is scraped off or neutralized.  The plasma cannon is thought to be a
legacy weapon left to the Invid from the time ex-EBSIS Lieutenant Anton Kosmos
worked with them to build the Annihilator and SH-AT combat mecha.
<P>
The Odeon Mk. II was encountered in two variants; as a worker and as a heavy
combat unit.  In its worker configuration both the missile launchers and the
laser cannons were removed from the inorganic, leaving only the plasma
launcher as a distance attack weapon.  Not all combat units were equipped with
missile launcher units; usually only 25% of Odeons (3 out of a typical squad
of 12) were equipped with launchers to provide support while their teammates
advanced.  Although the inorganics possessed independent intelligence and were
not directly linked to Invid Brains like older inorganics, they required
guidance and leadership from more evolved Invid to be of maximum effectiveness
in combat.  A Brawler without leadership will mindlessly attack an opponent
until either it or the opponent is destroyed.  Odeon 2 inorganics became very
common after 2044 and could be found at virtually every Invid Hive, base, and
slave camp around the world.  No Odeon Mk. IIs are known to have survived the
final battles of the Third Invid War.

<B>NOTES:</B>
<OL>
<LI> Destroying the protected sensor eye of the Odeon 2 will deprive it of its

     main sensor systems, but backup sensors will provide it with limited 
     vision and allow it to remain in a fight.  The Odeon 2 has a penalty of 
     -4 to strike, parry, and dodge if the main sensor eye is destroyed.
<LI> Destroying the main body will completely destroy the Inorganic.  The
     smoking remains will fall to the ground and crumble into scrap metal.
<LI> Destroying the top missile launcher will NOT detonate any remaining 
     missiles, but will prevent the missiles from being fired.  The missiles 
     must be individually targeted to detonate them (see below).

<LI><B>LASER CANNONS (2):</B>  When equipped for combat, each arm of the Odeon

    2 is equipped with a lance-like laser cannon, mounted at the elbow and 
    pointing forward.  These lasers are aimed by moving the Odeon's arms and 
    can be fired to the front or sides of the inorganic.  The cannons can also

    be used to generate a continuous laser beam for cutting and demolition 
    purposes.
    <P><UL>
    <LI><B>Primary Purpose</B>: Assault
    <LI><B>Secondary Purpose</B>: Defense
    <LI><B>Range</B>: 3000 ft (905 m)
    <LI><B>Damage</B>: 2D6 M.D., 4D6 M.D., or 1D6x10 M.D. per blast.  Bursts 
        are not possible, but the laser can be fired in a continuous stream 
        for cutting/demolition if necessary (does 4D6x10 M.D. per round).
    <LI><B>Rate of Fire</B>: Four attacks per cannon, per melee.  Both cannons

        can be fired simultaneously at the same target; counts as one attack. 

        The cannons can also be fired in a full melee continuous beam, but 
        suffer a -6 to strike a moving target.
    <LI><B>Payload</B>: Unlimited
    <LI><B>Bonuses to Strike</B>: Protoculture targeting bonuses only.
    </UL><P>
<LI><B>PLASMA CANNON:</B>  This weapon is roughly based on the devastating 
    plasma generator/ejector weapon that was a favorite mecha armament of the 
    Eastern Bloc Soviet Independent State (EBSIS).  On the left side of the 
    chest of the Odeon is a plasma generator that can "squirt" a stream of 
    high-temperature plasma at an enemy directly in front of the Odeon.  This 
    napalm-like plasma is devastating as it clings to its target and continues

    to do damage until scraped off, cooled, or the mecha is destroyed.  
    Fortunately the plasma cannon has a short range and can ONLY be fired at 
    targets directly in front of the Odeon; aiming at other targets requires 
    the Odeon to twist its entire torso.
    <P><UL>
    <LI><B>Primary Purpose</B>: Assault
    <LI><B>Secondary Purpose</B>: Demolition
    <LI><B>Range</B>: 300 ft (90.5 m)
    <LI><B>Damage</B>: 5D6 M.D. per round.  The plasma will continue to do 
        damage to any target it hits until it is neutralized.  The plasma can 
        be neutralized in one of three ways:
        <P><OL>
        <LI><B>Scraped Off</B>: The covered mecha can attempt to scrape the
plasma off itself with its hands.  This takes 1D6 melee rounds, during which
time the plasma does 2D6 M.D. to the mecha's hands and 3D6 M.D. to the covered
area per round.  Additional mecha can help scrape plasma off the target;
subtract 1 melee round per mecha helping, but the helping mecha receives 2D6
M.D. damage to its hands.
        <LI><B>Cooling</B>: If the covered mecha is near snow or water, it can
dive into the liquid to attempt to cool itself off rapidly.  Cooling the
plasma in this way takes 2 melee rounds.  After the first round the mecha will
receive only 2D6 damage, and after the second it will take no additional
damage.
        <LI><B>Extinguishing</B>: If a friendly mecha nearby is loaded with
fire-retardant missiles it can fire these missiles at the affected mecha in an
attempt to neutralize the plasma.  It takes two fire-retardant mini-missiles
or one fire-retardant SRM to completely neutralize the plasma.
        </OL><P>
        The plasma will eventually cool and neutralize itself, but this will 
        take 5D6 minutes, by which time the affected target is usually severly

        damaged or destroyed.  If a limb is struck with the plasma stream (the

        arm, for example) the target ceases to take damage once the limb is 
        destroyed.
    <LI><B>Rate of Fire</B>: Limited to once every other round to prevent 
        overheating.
    <LI><B>Payload</B>: Unlimited
    <LI><B>Bonuses to Strike</B>: Protoculture targeting bonuses only.
    </UL><P>
<LI><B>SHORT-RANGE MEDIUM-WARHEAD MISSILES:</B>  As an optional weapon system,

    the Odeon 2 can be mounted with a missile launcher on top of the 
    inorganic's jet backpack.  This launcher contains 4 short-range medium-
    warhead missiles that can be used for assault, destruction of 
    fortifications, or even anti-aircraft weapons.  The disadvantage of the 
    system is that the missiles are mounted externally and can be targeted and

    detonated prematurely before they are launched.  Each missile has 5 M.D.C.

    and is a small target (-4 to strike).  Hitting a missile before it is 
    launched instantly detonates all remaining missiles and does full damage 
    to the main body of the Odeon 2.  For this reason an Odeon 2 equipped with

    missiles will usually fire them within the first few rounds of combat.
    <P><UL>
    <LI><B>Primary Purpose</B>: Assault
    <LI><B>Secondary Purpose</B>: Anti-aircraft, anti-mecha
    <LI><B>Range</B>: 2 miles (3.2 km)
    <LI><B>Damage</B>: By missile type:
        <P><UL>
        <LI><B>High Explosive</B>: 2D6x10 M.D., 30 ft (9.1 m) blast radius.

        </UL><P>
    <LI><B>Rate of Fire</B>: One missile per attack, volleys are not possible.
 
        All four missiles can be fired in a single melee round by expending 
        all four attacks.
    <LI><B>Payload</B>: 4 missiles total.
    <LI><B>Bonuses to Strike</B>: Each missile is equipped with a protoculture

        sensor.  The missiles have a +3 bonus to strike an active protoculture

        source, otherwise they are treated as unguided missiles (no bonuses or

        penalties).
    </UL><P>
<LI><B>HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT:</B>  The Odeon 2 is incredibly strong and can do 
    massive hand-to-hand damage if allowed to get into melee combat range.  
    Smart resistance fighters will try to stay out of the reach of the Odeon 2

    and engage it at a distance.
