<H1>THE VAF-8 ALPHA FIGHTER</H1>
<H2>BACKGROUND</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT BORDER=2 HSPACE=3 SRC="./Images/vaf8pict.gif">
The <B>VAF-8 Transatmospheric Alpha Fighters</B> were the standard Veritech 
fighters of the REF during the <B>Third Invid War</B>.  Designed on Tirol by 
the engineers of <B>Project Shadowchaser</B>, the VAF-8 was the first original 
mecha designed from the ground up around the new cloaking technology developed 
to counter the Invid protoculture tracking technology.  The original SF-7 Cloaking 
Device had been outfitted on a small group of mecha, mostly VAF-6 Alphas and a few 
Mk III Gladiator Destroids.  These new mecha (the <I>VAF-7A Alphas</I> and <I>Mk IV 
Gladiators</I>) were mainly technical experiments and were not really intended
for mass production or use in combat.  However, the push to equip the REF
Jupiter mission with the latest technology necessitated these mecha being
included with the mission's warships, and most of the prototype units were
destroyed during the final battles of the Second Invid War.
<P>
During the lull following the Jupiter Mission's departure from Tirol, the
VAF-8 Alpha and <A HREF="./vbf2.html">VBF-2 Beta Fighters</A> were perfected 
and put into production.  The VAF-8 was intended to be the next main fighter 
for the REF, and as such was designed with mass-production in mind.  The main
design of the fighter centered around two brand new systems in the
REF arsenal, the SF-10 Shadow Cloaking Device and the FF-3000
Fusion/Protoculture Variable Turbine Engines.  The SF-10 was a more advanced
version of the shadow cloak intended to be more reliable and cheaper to
produce, although cloaking device production still remained the bottleneck of
the VAF-8 production line.  The FF-3000 was a new high-efficiency engine
designed for use on transatmospheric fighters.  The engine contained a
variable thrust system that could use either air intakes (like a ramjet) or
internal fuel supplies (like a rocket) to produce thrust.  This made the mecha
transatmospheric; the Alphas could be launched from an orbiting starship,
engage in orbital combat, enter a planet's atmosphere to engage ground
targets, and then escape the planet's atmosphere to return to the starship
after the mission is complete.  This engine fit in well with REF analyst
predictions that most future mecha fighting would be fought in terms of
orbital-to-ground engagements.  Other improvements to the VAF-8 included an
increased SRM load, wing hardpoints for variable missile loads, and the new
GU-25 multipurpose gun pod.
<P>
After the Jupiter mission failed to report back from Earth, the threat of
continued warfare with the Invid began to resurface.  Mass production of the
VAF-8 began in 2039, as the REF rebuilt and prepared for another possible
conflict.  Initially there were 3 different models of the VAF-8; the VAF-8A,
VAF-8J, and VAF-8S.  Although nearly identical in capabilities, the VAF-8A was
intended for use by standard pilots, the VAF-8J by low-ranking officers, and
the VAF-8S by squadron leaders.  During the planning for the Icarus Recon
Mission in 2042, Colonels John Korcheck and Roger Harris requested a special
version of the VAF-8 for reconnaissance and electronic warfare.  The REF R&amp;D
department developed the VAF-8R Recon Alpha Fighter to fulfill that request.
The VAF-8R was slightly different from previous versions of the VAF-8, mostly
because of the advanced sensor systems equipped on the Alpha.  In addition,
the VAF-8R was equipped with a copilot's station directly behind the pilot's
station.  This copilot was not actually intended to help fly the plane, but
instead served to collect and correlate the massive amounts of data from the
mecha's sensors.  These copilots, called Recon Equipment Operators (REOs),
were mostly intelligence officers who would analyze data and communicate it
back to the command ship while the pilot and his escorts engaged the enemy and
protected the VAF-8R.
<P>
Hundreds of VAF-8s were produced for the REF Icarus and Prometheus missions. 
Due to the rush for production, many VAF-8s were sent into service without the
SF-10 cloaking device, which could simply not be produced fast enough to keep
up with demand.  Roughly 60% of the fighters used by Icarus and Prometheus
were not equipped with SF-10 cloaking devices.  Despite this flaw, the VAF-8s
served well during the Third Invid War.  Even with the blockade created by the
<A HREF="./spacehive.html">Invid Orbiting Hives</A>, many VAF-8 Alphas made 
it to Earth to bolster the resistance forces there.  However, attrition prevented 
the numbers on Earth from ever becoming too high, as the Invid blockade made 
spares and replacement parts hard to come by on occupied Earth.
<P>
The VAF-8 served as the major fighter of the REF (and later the Robotech
Guardian Forces) from 2040 up until 2058, when it was replaced by the VAF-9
Mark II.  Even after production ceased, the VAF-8 remained a common fighter
inthe RGF arsenal for decades, commonly seen throughout Sentinels Alliance
territory until almost the end of the 21st century.
<P>
The VAF-8 series Veritechs have the sleek, angular lines of the VAF-6 Alpha
series, but are equipped with swing wings (as in the VF-1 series fighter) and
redesigned leg/engine units.  The head of the mecha is located ventrally in
fighter and Guardian modes, and each wing contains a single hardpoint for
variable missile loads, both similar to the older VF-1 Veritechs.  The VAF-8
series marks the return of the REF to distinctive head styles to indicate
rank.  Though the head-mounted lasers are exactly the same for each model, the
head shapes are different and recognizable for each version of the Alpha.  In
addition, each fighter has highlight colors and identification numbers painted
in different colors by model.  The VAF-8A is color is blue; the VAF-8J is red;
VAF-8S is green.  The rest of the mecha's color scheme is usually based on
where the unit is stationed; i.e. space Veritechs are often painted flat
black, desert Veritechs are painted with a light tan camouflage, etc.  Some of
the shadow-equipped models are painted black with red canopies, perhaps out of
nostalgia or a whimsical sense of humor on the part of the factory
technicians.  The VAF-8R has a slightly elongated and raised nose compartment
to accommodate the additional REO crew member, and a shoulder-mounted sensor
unit that contains many of the advanced sensor systems for the Recon Alpha.
VAF-8Rs are usually highlighted in white to distinguish them from 8As, 8Js,
and 8Ss.  The VAF-8R uses the same head design as the VAF-8J Alpha.

<LI> Destroying the head will destroy all optical enhancements and cause
     penalties of -2 to strike, parry, and dodge.  Main communications is
     also destroyed for the fighter, though a backup radio system provides
     the veritech with short-range radio communications.  Radar is stored
     in another area of the plane and is unaffected.
<LI> Depleting the MDC of the sensor unit on the VAF-8R will destroy many of
     the Recon Veritech's advanced sensor systems.  The XR-A Doppler Radar,
     Sonar, and Nightvision Optics are all lost.
<LI> Depleting the M.D.C. of the main body will shut the mecha down
     completely, rendering it useless.  Be sure to note the special rules
     regarding failure of the SF-10 cloaking device, listed in the Equipment
     section.

    or battloid (similar to the old VF-1 Veritech).  In combat the lasers are
    limited to the number of attacks the pilot has, but they can also be used
    in a continuous beam, making them useful for cutting or demolitions.<P>

<LI><B>Mega-Damage</B>: 4D6, or 2D6 if only one is fired.  The lasers can
also be
      fired in a long continuous blast that lasts the entire round and does
      2D6x10 M.D.  However, this mode is unsuitable for combat purposes and
      imposes a -2 to strike rolls to attack moving targets.
<LI><B>Range</B>: 4000 ft

    bombardments.  Each hardpoint can mount 1 long range missile, 3 medium
    range missiles, or one pod of mini-missiles.  These missiles do NOT have
    to be dropped prior to transformation into battloid mode; however, the
    missiles cannot be fired in battloid mode because they are covered by
    the tail fins of the mecha.
<P>

<LI><B>STEALTH RECON PODS (2, typically used by the VAF-8R)</B>: The VAF-8R
    Recon Veritech is usually equipped with two special electronic warfare
    suites instead of missiles on the wing hardpoints.  Called Stealth Recon
    Pods (SRPs), these pods are actually remote-controlled robot vehicles
    used for data gathering and reconnaissance, spy satellites, or beacons.
    The SRPs are powered by miniaturized fusion reactors and contain NO
    protoculture systems, making them undetectable by Invid protoculture
    sensors.  The SRPs contain an internal antigravity engine that allows them
    to maneuver at will after being launched, or even return to the VAF-8R
    after completion of a mission.  The SRPs must be controlled by a human
    operator (usually the REO) at all times, as they do not possess any form
    of artificial intelligence guidance.  Like the missiles, the SRPs do not
    need to be ejected before the Recon Alpha converts into battloid mode.<P>

<H3>STANDARD EQUIPMENT</H3>
<UL>
<LI><B><A NAME="sf10">SF-10 SHADOW CLOAKING DEVICE</A></B>:  VAF-8 series Alpha Fighters are
designed to
   use the SF-10 Cloaking Device, the new standard cloaking device for the
   REF.  A much improved version of the original SF-7 cloaking device, this
   version incorporates changes that makes the device smaller and more
   affordable to manufacture.  The device still operates like older versions;
   rendering the mecha invisible to all electronic forms of detection,
   including radar, Invid Protoculture sensors, and microwaves.  Only light-
   based detection systems, such as optical and laser tracking will detect the
   mecha.
<P>
   The SF-10 is the first cloaking device to feature THREE modes of operation
   instead of only two: ON, in which the device operates normally; OFF, in
   which the device is shut off and the mecha is detectable by all forms of
   electronic detection; and SAFETY, in which the device emits a "4th
   dimensional blip," which is detectable by other REF mecha's collision
   warning systems.  The SAFETY mode is used for close formations where mecha
   proximity could potentially cause disastrous collisions.
<P>
   The SF-10 is slightly more reliable than its predecessor.  Once the main
   body MDC of the fighter has been reduced to 200 M.D. or less, there is a
   cumulative 10% chance of the SF-10 failing for every 20 points of damage
   beyond that.  For example,there is a 10% chance of the device failing when
   the main body MDC is between 180-200, 20% when the MDC is between 160-180,
   30% when the MDC is between 140-160, etc.  Once a cloaking device fails it
   CANNOT be repaired; it must be replaced by another working SF-10, either
   from a salvaged fighter or a parts depot.
<P>
<B>BONUSES</B>: (ON and SAFETY modes) The Veritech always gets first attack
in the
   first round of combat.  After that, the mecha has a +3 on all initiative
   rolls.  Also provides an additional +2 to dodge, and +1 to strike.
<P>
<LI><B>LASER-RESISTANT CERAMIC COATING</B>:  A Southern Cross invention, this
   coating scrambles laser tracking and reduces laser damage by half (lasers
   ONLY).
<P>
<LI><B>RADAR</B>: The VAF-8 is equipped with a dual radar system.  The first
  system is a <I>long range radar</I> that has a range of over 100 miles (160
  km) and
  can track up to 25 targets simultaneously within that range.  The problem
  with the system, however, is that the powerful long distance radar waves
  tend to give away the position of the craft; attackers using radar-guided
  weaponry have a +2 to hit the VAF-8 while the system is on.
  <P>
  The second radar is a <I>combat radar</I> that has a range of 10 miles 
  (16 km) and can identify and track up to 100 targets simultaneously.  This
  radar uses frequency hopping and a number of other techniques to prevent
  its emissions from giving away the position of the VAF-8.
  <P>
  NOTE: In general, Invid do <B>NOT</B> use radar-tracking weapons.
<P>
<LI><B>RADIO COMMUNICATIONS</B>:  Wide band and directional radio and video
telecast
   capabilities.  Range is 600 miles (945 km) or can be boosted indefinitely
   via satellite relay.
<P>
<LI><B>LASER COMMUNICATIONS</B>:  Long-range, directional communication
system.
   Effective range: 100,000 miles (157,500 km).
<P>
<LI><B>COMBAT COMPUTER</B>:  Calculates, stores, and transmits data onto
the cockpit
   computer screen or heads-up display (H.U.D.) of the pilot's helmet.
   Patches in with targeting computer.
<P>
<LI><B>TARGETING COMPUTER</B>:  Assists in the tracking of enemy targets and
is
   partly responsible for the VAF-8's high strike bonus.
<P>
<LI><B>LASER TARGETING SYSTEM</B>:  100 mile (160 km) range.  Assists in
the striking
   of enemy targets and is partly responsible for the VAF-8's high strike
   bonus.
<P>
<LI><B>MOTION DETECTOR AND COLLISION WARNING SYSTEM</B>:  500 ft (152.5 m)
range.
   Sounds an alarm and red light warns pilot of impending collision and/or
   immediate target.
<P>
<LI><B>TELESCOPIC OPTICAL ENHANCEMENT</B>:  2000 ft (609 m) range.  20 ft
(6.1 m)
   field of vision.
<P>
<LI><B>HEAD SPOTLIGHTS</B>:  600 ft (182 m) range, normal light.
<P>
<LI><B>INFRARED SPOTLIGHT</B>:  2000 ft (609 m) range.  The infrared
spotlight sits
   in the front of the sensor head.  It emits an infrared light beam that is
   invisible to the normal eye.  However, an enemy with infrared optics can
   easily see the beam of light and track it to the Veritech.  Smoke impairs
   vision/beam.
<P>
<LI><B>THERMO-IMAGER</B>:  2000 ft (609 m) range.  A special optical heat
sensory
   unit that allows the infrared radiation of warm objects to be converted
   into a visible image.  It also enables the pilot to see in darkness,
   shadows and through smoke.
<P>
<LI><B>EXTERNAL AUDIO PICKUP</B>:  300 ft (91.5 m) range.  A sound
amplification
   listening system that can pick up a whisper 300 ft away.
<P>
<LI><B>EXTERNAL VIDEO SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM</B>:  600 ft (183 m) range.  A
video camera
   system with telescopic capabilities (8x magnification) is built into the
   head.  The video images can be relayed to a cockpit monitor and stored on
   removable video disks.  Maximum disk capacity is 24 hours.  Disks can be
   erased and reused.
<P>
<LI><B>EJECTOR SEAT</B>:  In case of an emergency, the pilot can be
instantly ejected.
   In battloid mode, the pilot is ejected out of the mecha's back.
<P>
<LI><B>CE-1 CYCLONE EJECTOR SYSTEM</B>:  Also in case of an emergency, the
VR-135
   Forager Cyclone will also be ejected from the doomed mecha.  This system is
   activated automatically when the pilot pulls the ejection lever.  The
   cyclone will deploy parachutes once outside of the mecha and then land
   within 1D6x1000 feet of the pilot.  This system was installed to allow
   pilots to retrieve their cyclones even after their veritechs had been
   destroyed.
<P>
<LI><B>SELF-DESTRUCT</B>:  A last ditch effort to prevent the capture of a
Veritech
   unit (usually preceded by the pilot's ejection from the Veritech) is 
   self-destruction. 
   Explosive damage is fairly contained.  A VAF-8 Alpha without
   missiles (or few) does 2D6 x 10 M.D., but a Veritech with all or most of
   its missiles (35 or more) will do 2D6 x 100 M.D. to a 50 ft (15.2 m)
   radius.
<P>
<LI><B>SMOKE SCREEN SYSTEM</B>:  The VAF-8 Assault Alpha can emit a thick
cloud of
   smoke from its rear to create immediate cover.  The smoke screen system can
   discharge a maximum of 4 bursts before needing replacement (smoke missiles
   can be converted to function in the system).  Each burst will cover a 60 ft
   area (19.8 m).
<P>
<LI><B>HEAT AND RADIATION SHIELDS</B>:  Special shielding prevents the
penetration
   of life-threatening heat and radiation.
<P>
<LI><B>INDEPENDENT OXYGEN AND CIRCULATORY SYSTEM</B>: Built-in tanks provide
48
   hours of continuous oxygen.  A special recycling system can keep the air
   breathable for a maximum of one week.
<P>
<LI><B>SURVIVAL GEAR</B>: The VAF-8 includes a VR-135 Forager Cyclone, four
weeks'
   compact emergency rations, an emergency signal beacon, three first-aid
   kits, and a life raft.  There is space for an energy rifle to be attached
   to each ejector seat, and the pilot can of course carry a side-arm.
</UL>
<P>
<H3>SPECIAL EQUIPMENT FOR VAF-8R RECON VERITECHS</H3>

  Because of their primary duty as the main intelligence gathering mecha for
  the Icarus forces, the VAF-8R Alphas were equipped with additional sensor
  systems not found on standard VAF-8 Veritechs.  Most of these systems are
  included in the external sensor unit on the shoulder of the mecha, and loss
  of this unit will seriously reduce the VAF-8R's reconnaissance capabilities.
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>XR-A EXTERNAL DOPPLER TRACKING RADAR</B>: 300 mile (480 km) range, and
   can identify and track up to 140 targets simultaneously.  However, the
   powerful waves of this radar create a tremendous radar image on enemy 
   screens, giving enemies with radar tracking capabilities a +4 (!) to hit
   the Veritech.
<P>
<LI><B>SONAR</B>: 20 mile (32 km) range underwater.  Can identify and track
up to 30
   targets simultaneously.
<P>
<LI><B>RECONNAISSANCE CORRELATION COMPUTER</B>: Operated by the Recon
Equipment
   Operator (REO), this high-tech computer system analyzes reconnaissance data
   and projects it on the REO's screens.  This system is also tied in with the
   Combat and Targeting computers of the mecha; the REO decides what data
   should receive the pilot's attention.
<P>
<LI><B>NIGHT VISION OPTICS</B>:  4000 ft (1812 m) range.  An image
intensifier that is
   passive, meaning it emits no light of its own, but relies on ambient light
   which is electronically amplified to give a visible picture.  Night vision
   can not work in absolute darkness (but infrared and thermo-imagers can).
<P>
<LI><B>TELESCOPIC IMAGE SENSORS</B>:  Can magnify a visual image up to
1,000 times.
<P>
<LI><B>"BLACK-BOX" TELEMETRY RECORD SYSTEM</B>:  A special reusable laserdisc
   recording system records all visuals and data collected by the REO from the
   Alpha's sensor systems for later analysis.  Each disc can contain up to 36
   hours worth of complete telemetry, including visuals, audio, and sensor
   readings from all instruments.  The recorder is specially shielded to
   survive a crash (M.D.C. 100) and can be recovered later in the event that
   the VAF-8R is shot down.
<P>
<LI><B>SEISMIC SENSOR SYSTEM</B>: When on the ground, sensors in the
VAF-8's legs are
   used in concert with the laser targeting system to read the passage of
   vehicles or major troop movement, as well as natural and unnatural seismic
   activity, within a range of 20 miles (greater in case of large vibrations).
   The reconnaissance correlation computer can read out, with a 70%
   probability, the approximate types and numbers of troops/vehicles, or the
   Richter Scale ranking of the seismic disturbance and distance to its
   epicenter.  This system was often used to detect the location of Invid
   Genesis Pits during the war.
<P>
<LI><B>EJECTOR SEAT</B>:  Both the pilot and the REO are equipped with
ejection seats
   in case of emergency.  These seats may eject in either fighter or battloid
   mode.
<P>
<LI><B>SURVIVAL GEAR</B>: The VAF-8R includes one Cyclone cycle (the REO
must walk),
   four weeks' compact emergency rations, an emergency signal beacon, three
   first-aid kits, and a life raft.  There is space for an energy rifle to be
   attached to each ejector seat, and the pilot and REO can of course each
   carry a side-arm with them.
