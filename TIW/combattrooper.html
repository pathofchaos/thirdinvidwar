<H1>THE INVID COMBAT TROOPER</H1>
<H2>BACKGROUND</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=238 HEIGHT=347 BORDER=2 HSPACE=3
 SRC="./Images/combattrooper.gif">
The first new Invid mecha design to appear on Earth was the Combat
Trooper in 2043.  The new trooper mecha seemed to suddenly appear all
over the Earth simultaneously, completely replacing the older Shock Trooper 
design wherever it was found.  Within a month reports of Shock Troopers had
dwindled to almost nothing, while the deadly new Combat Trooper became
the main front-line battle mecha for the Invid forces.
<P>
Stylistically, the Combat Trooper design is so close to the old Shock
Trooper mecha that the two could almost be mistaken for each other at a
quick glance.  The Combat Trooper has the same long broad legs, large
forearm shields with three-fingered claws, and compact central body
design as the old Shock Trooper did.  However, the similarities end
there.  First off, the Combat Trooper stands 32.2 feet tall; almost
twice the size of the Shock Trooper and larger than a VAF-6 Alpha in
battloid mode!  The twin plasma cannons on the back of the mecha are now
longer and more powerful than their predecessors.  These cannons are
modular and can be replaced with other weapon systems for specialized
attacks.  Two common weapon packages are a pair of heat cannons (like
the ones on the old Invid Command Unit) and a pair of heavy missile
launchers.  In addition, the Combat Trooper has four pulse beam cannon,
similar to those of the Attack Scout.  Two cannons are located on either
side of the central sensor eye.  A Short-range missile launcher on the
back of the mecha between the plasma cannons completes the new
armaments.  Invid Combat Troopers are dark green and grey in color.
<P>
As a ground combatant, the Invid Combat Trooper is far superior to the
old Shock Trooper mecha.  It does have one major weakness, though; its
slow speed.  The Combat Trooper's air and ground speeds are
approximately equal to those of the Shock Trooper, which means that REF
mecha are much faster and more agile than the Invid units.  REF pilots
must still be careful, though; the Combat Trooper can do devastating
damage if any of its weapons ever manage to connect...

<B>Notes:</B>
<DL>
<DT>+
<DD> The combat trooper will only have ONE pair of main weapons.  Choose
    one weapon type for each combat trooper.  Heavy plasma cannons are
    the most common type of weapon for the mecha.
<DT>&amp;
<DD> The pulse beam cannons are slightly difficult to hit; -2 penalty.
<DT>*
<DD> The sensor eye is the most vulnerable place on the Invid's mecha
    body.  Destruction of the sensor eye will kill/destroy the mecha and
    pilot (goes right through crew compartment).  However, it is a small
    target protected by surrounding shielding, thus, to hit it the
    player/character must make a called shot and is at -3 to strike.
<DT>**
<DD> Depleting the M.D.C. of the main body will shut the mecha down
    completely.  Depleting the pilot compartment M.D.C. will blow the
    Invid to pieces.

<H3>WEAPON SYSTEMS</H3>
<OL>
<LI><B>HEAVY PLASMA CANNONS</B>.  These large plasma cannons are updated
   versions of those originally found on the old Invid Shock Trooper.
   However, they are much more powerful and have a far greater range than
   the older models.  One cannon is mounted over each shoulder, and both
   cannons can fire independently or simultaneously.  The plasma energy is
   still released in Frisbee-like "annihilation discs," just like the older
   model.  The cannons can point up or down in a 90 degree arc.<P>
   <UL>
   <LI><B>Primary Purpose</B>: Assault
   <LI><B>Secondary Purpose</B>: Anti-Aircraft
   <LI><B>Range</B>: 6000 ft (1800 m)
   <LI><B>Damage</B>: One single blast does 4D6 M.D., dual blasts do 8D6 M.D. 
     and simultaneous bursts do 2D4x10 M.D.  A continuous stream, lasting
     one full melee and directed at a single target, does 3D6x10
     M.D.(!!)  A strafing run (wild shooting) does 4D6 M.D. per hit.
   <LI><B>Rate of Fire</B>: Four attacks per melee.  Dual blasts and bursts 
     both count as ONE attack.
   <LI><B>Payload</B>: Unlimited
   <LI><B>Bonuses to Strike</B>: Protoculture targeting bonuses only.
   <LI><B>Note</B>: the mouths of the plasma cannons glow white just before 
     they fire, just like their predecessors.
   </UL><P>

<LI><B>(OPTIONAL) HEAT CANNONS</B>.  The Combat Trooper can also be mounted 
   with heat cannons, similar to those mounted on the pincer command unit.
   Both cannons fire simultaneously, though if one cannon is destroyed
   the other can still fire.  Both cannons must fire at the same target.
   <P>
   Although fixed in a forward position, the rotating inner nozzles of
   the cannons can adjust to about a 30 degree angle.  To shoot in a
   different direction or greater angle, the Combat Trooper must move
   its entire body.  A favorite tactic is to fly several hundred feet
   (200 to 1000 ft) above the ground and blast opposing ground units.
   <P><UL>
   <LI><B>Primary Purpose</B>: Assault
   <LI><B>Range</B>: 4000 ft (1200 m)
   <LI><B>Damage</B>: Single cannon blast does 3D6 M.D., and a dual cannon 
     blast does 6D6 M.D.  A Long Blast (counts as two attacks) does 2D4x10
     M.D.  A concentrated blast (both cannons, focused at same target
     all melee) does 3D6x10 M.D.  A continuous-beam strafing run does
     3D6 M.D. to everything it hits.
   <LI><B>Rate of Fire</B>: Four attacks per melee.  Dual blasts count as ONE
     attack.
   <LI><B>Payload</B>: Unlimited
   <LI><B>Bonuses to Strike</B>: +1 to strike at all times, against any target.
     Add in protoculture targeting bonuses for targets that use
     protoculture.
   <LI><B>Note</B>: the mouths of the heat cannons glow white just before they
     fire, just like their predecessors.
   </UL><P>
<LI><B>(OPTIONAL) LONG-RANGE MISSILE LAUNCHERS</B>.  A third optional weapons
   package for the Combat trooper is a pair of long-range missile
   launchers.  Each launcher can hold 4 missiles, and all missiles can
   be fired independently or in volleys.  This weapons package is
   typically only used in siege operations.
   <P>
   NOTE: There is only one type of Invid long-range missile.  It is a
   combination plasma/high explosive missile that seemed to be designed
   with fortification destruction in mind.  Although extremely powerful,
   it is an UNGUIDED missile and gets no bonuses to strike.
   <P><UL>
   <LI><B>Primary Purpose</B>: Heavy Assault
   <LI><B>Secondary Purpose</B>: Destruction of fortifications
   <LI><B>Maximum Range</B>: 200 miles (320 km)
   <LI><B>Speed</B>: 1400 mph (2251 kmph)
   <LI><B>Damage</B>: 3D6x10 M.D. per missile.
   <LI><B>Rate of Fire</B>: One at a time, or in volleys of 2, 4, 6, or 8 
     (all).
   <LI><B>Payload</B>: 4 missiles per launcher, 8 missiles total.
   <LI><B>M.D.C. of Missile</B>: 20
   <LI><B>Bonuses to Strike</B>: <B>NO</B> bonuses to strike.
   </UL><P>
<LI><B>PULSE BEAM CANNONS</B>.  Four small Invid beam cannons are mounted in 
   the main body of the mecha, two on either side of the sensor eye.  The
   weapons can rotate to a maximum of 30 degrees in any direction.  All
   four cannons can fire in unison or independently of one another.
   <P><UL>
   <LI><B>Primary Purpose</B>: Defense
   <LI><B>Secondary Purpose</B>: Close-range assault
   <LI><B>Range</B>: 3000 ft (900 m)
   <LI><B>Damage</B>: One single blast (rare) does 2D6 M.D., dual blasts
     (simultaneous shots, same target) do 4D6 M.D., and quad blasts
     (all four cannons aimed at same target) do 6D6 M.D.  A four-cannon
     burst (12 blasts, all at same target) does 8D6 M.D.
   <LI><B>Rate of Fire</B>: Four attacks per melee.  Dual and quad blasts and
     bursts count as ONE attack.
   <LI><B>Payload</B>: Unlimited
   <LI><B>Bonuses to Strike</B>: +1 to strike, plus protoculture targeting 
     bonuses.
   </UL><P>
<LI><B>SRM MISSILE LAUNCHER</B>.  A small missile launcher is built into the 
   top of the mecha, in between the shoulders and plasma cannons.  It is
   normally recessed into the mecha, and pops up to fire.
   <P><UL>
   <LI><B>Primary Purpose</B>: Assault
   <LI><B>Secondary Purpose</B>: Anti-Aircraft, Anti-Cyclone
   <LI><B>Missile Type</B>: Almost always Plasma SRMs.
   <LI><B>Range</B>: 5 miles (8 km)
   <LI><B>Mega-Damage</B>: 1D6x10 M.D.
   <LI><B>Rate of Fire</B>: One at a time or in volleys of 2-5 missiles.  Can 
     only fire a maximum of 5 missiles at a time!
   <LI><B>Payload</B>: 20 missiles.
   <LI><B>Bonuses to Strike</B>: +3 to strike (but no protoculture bonuses)
   </UL><P>
<LI><B>HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT</B>.  Though a slow combatant, the Combat Trooper 
   can do lots of damage if it manages to hit!
   <P><UL>
   <LI><B>Attacks Per Melee</B>: Four
   <LI><B>Hand to Hand Bonuses</B>: No bonus to strike, +2 to parry, no bonus 
     to dodge on the ground, +1 to dodge when in flight, +1 to roll with a
     punch, fall, or impact.
   <LI><B>Types of Attacks</B>: Punch/Claw: 6D6 M.D.  Crush with Hand: 
     2D6 M.D. per melee round.  Body Block/Ram: 4D6 M.D., counts as two 
     attacks.  Stomp: 4D6 M.D., target must be 15 ft (4.5 m) or smaller.
