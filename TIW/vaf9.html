<H2>BACKGROUND</H2>
The <B>VAF-9 Heavy Assault Alpha Fighter</B>
was an experimental air/space superiority fighter
designed and produced during the early days of the <B>Third Invid War</B>.  Intended
to be the spearhead of an assault to retake the Earth from the second invasion
force of Invid, the VAF-9 was definitely the most advanced mecha of the war and
probably one of the most advanced Veritechs of the 21st century.  The VAF-9
incorporated all of the cutting-edge technology available to the REF R&amp;D
scientists assigned to <B>Project Shadowchaser</B>.  The mecha was designed 
around the new FF-4000X Experimental
Fusion/Protoculture Variable Turbines, which could supply tremendous thrust
and maneuvering power both inside and outside of an atmosphere.  The mecha was
made slightly larger to incorporate several new weapon systems, including the
new MM-74 SRM missile system and the TWR-30 head-mounted Pulse Lasers.
Another revolutionary system used with the VAF-9 was the Falcon MRM Missile
System; the Falcon system stored missiles inside the wings instead of on
hardpoints, allowing the mecha to convert into battloid mode and, if
necessary, use the missiles while in that mode.  To top off the new mecha's
armaments, a pair of GR-12 shoulder mounted missile systems (formerly used on
the VAF-7A) were added, as well as a pair of caseless 32mm depleted uranium
autocannons mounted on the arms of the mecha.  For a hand weapon, the VAF-9
was equipped with the EU-XX Destabilizer Cannon, the latest version of the
famous EU-12 and EU-13 Destabilizers used during the Second Invid War.
<P>
In terms of development, the VAF-9 Alpha was very much like the VAF-7A Alpha.
Both were revolutionary technical experiments that were pressed into service
by the REF to help reclaim the Earth.  The disadvantage of the design was its
immense cost, however.  The cost of a single VAF-9 was equal to an entire
SQUADRON of VAF-8 Alphas.  In addition, the mecha was a nightmare for support
crews to maintain due to an immense number of special parts that were always
in short supply.  But despite the costs, a squadron of 12 VAF-9 Alphas and 12
VBF-3 Betas (the counterpart to the VAF-9), were included with the Icarus
Recon Mission, and although records from the aftermath of that mission are
spotty it appears that all of them made it to Earth and into resistance hands.
Several squadrons of VAF-9 were included with the Prometheus Assault Group, and
were very effective during the final battles of the Third Invid War, even
though superior firepower from the Invid Orbiting Hives prevented the 
Prometheus Group from ever gaining the upper hand.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>NOTE:</B> Due to their scarcity, encountering a VAF-9 Alpha on Earth during 
the Third Invid War should be a VERY rare occurrance.  Only 11 VAF-9s made it to
earth from the ill-fated Icarus Recon Mission, and of those 11 three have been
confirmed destroyed by the Invid.  The fate of the remaining 8 is left up to the
GM, but players should be required to go on a LONG adventure and face MANY dangers
before they can get their hands on a VAF-9. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The VAF-9 was never mass-produced.  After the end of the Third Invid War, a
number of squadrons were built to replace destroyed mecha, but distribution
of the fighters were never widespread.  In 2058, <I>Vanguard Aerospace</I>
and <I>Tirolian Weapons Research</I> jointly produced the 
<B>VAF-9 Mark II</B>, a
cheaper version of the VAF-9 incorporating updated technology.  The VAF-9 Mk.
II replaced the VAF-8 as the standard <B><I>Robotech Guardian Forces 
(RGF)</I></B> fighter
for a few years, but was itself replaced during the RGF reorganization of
2065.  After that the original VAF-9s mostly disappeared, with only a few 
surviving examples (minus weapons and armor) in the hands of museums or 
private collectors.
<P>
The VAF-9 Heavy Assault Alpha Fighter vaguely resembles its distant cousin,
the VAF-6 Alpha Fighter, but is somewhat larger and much more streamlined and
as a more pronounced delta-wing design.  Like the VAF-8, the color scheme for
the VAF-9 is based on where the unit is stationed, i.e. space Veritechs are
usually painted flat black, desert Veritechs are painted with a light tan
camouflage, etc.  The Veritech is always streamlined with a color to indicate
it's model type.  VAF-9C's are streamlined in blue, VAF-9J's in red, and VAF-
9S's in green.  Each model also has a unique head style, but unlike the
original VF-1 Veritech all three models have the exact same armament.

<LI>Destruction of the sensor head will greatly reduce the pilot's sensory and
    targeting equipment, though backup systems prevent total sensory
    blindness.  Long-range radar  is reduced to 2 mile range.  Radio and Laser
    communication systems  are lost, but an auxiliary system provides voice-
    only radio with a 100 mile range.  Head Spotlights, Thermo-Imager, Night
    vision Optics, Audio Pickup, and Head Lasers are lost.  Laser targeting
    is also destroyed; -1 to strike.
<LI>Destruction of the main body will shut the unit down completely.
</OL>
<B>NOTE</B>: The VAF-9 Series Veritech incorporates the Southern Cross' laser
      resistant ceramic armor, so laser weapons do only HALF damage.  This
      does NOT include any other energy attacks such as particle beams or ion
      blasts, nor does it help against explosives.

<H3>STANDARD SENSORS AND EQUIPMENT FOR VAF-9 ALPHA FIGHTERS</H3>
<UL>
<LI><A NAME="sf10"><B>SF-10 SHADOW CLOAKING DEVICE</B></A>:  
   Like the VAF-8, the VAF-9 Alpha Fighter is
   designed to use the SF-10 Cloaking Device, the new standard cloaking device
   for the REF.  A much improved version of the original SF-7 cloaking device,
   this version incorporates changes that makes the device smaller and more
   affordable to manufacture.  The device still operates like older versions;
   rendering the mecha invisible to all electronic forms of detection,
   including radar, Invid Protoculture sensors, and microwaves.  Only light-
   based detection systems, such as optical and laser tracking will detect the
   mecha.
<P>
   The SF-10 is the first cloaking device to feature THREE modes of operation
   instead of only two: ON, in which the device operates normally; OFF, in
   which the device is shut off and the mecha is detectable by all forms of
   electronic detection; and SAFETY, in which the device emits a "4th
   dimensional blip," which is detectable by other REF mecha's collision
   warning systems.  The SAFETY mode is used for close formations where mecha
   proximity could potentially cause disastrous collisions.
<P>
   The SF-10 is slightly more reliable than its predecessor.  Once the main
   body MDC of the fighter has been reduced to 200 M.D. or less, there is a
   cumulative 10% chance of the SF-10 failing for every 20 points of damage
   beyond that.  For example,there is a 10% chance of the device failing when
   the main body MDC is between 200-180, 20% when the MDC is between 160-180,
   30% when the MDC is between 140-160, etc.  Once a cloaking device fails it
   CANNOT be repaired; it must be replaced by another working SF-10, either
   from a salvaged fighter or a parts depot.
<P>
   <B>BONUSES</B>: (ON and SAFETY modes) The Veritech always gets first
attack in the
   first round of combat.  After that, the mecha has a +3 on all initiative
   rolls.  Also provides an additional +2 to dodge, and +1 to strike.
<P>
<LI><B>LASER-RESISTANT CERAMIC COATING</B>:  A Southern Cross invention,
this coating
   scrambles laser tracking and reduces laser damage by half (lasers ONLY).
<P>
<LI><B>RADAR</B>: The VAF-9 is equipped with a dual radar system.  The first
  system is a <I>long range radar</I> that has a range of over 100 miles (160
  km) and
  can track up to 30 targets simultaneously within that range.  The problem
  with the system, however, is that the powerful long distance radar waves
  tend to give away the position of the craft; attackers using radar-guided
  weaponry have a +2 to hit the VAF-9 while the system is on.
  <P>
  The second radar is a <I>combat radar</I> that has a range of 15 miles
  (24 km) and can identify and track up to 150 targets simultaneously.  This
  radar uses frequency hopping and a number of other techniques to prevent
  its emissions from giving away the position of the VAF-9.
  <P>
  NOTE: In general, Invid do <B>NOT</B> use radar-tracking weapons.
<P>
<LI><B>RADIO COMMUNICATIONS</B>:  Wide band and directional radio and video
telecast
   capabilities.  Range is 750 miles (1180 km) or can be boosted indefinitely
   via satellite relay.

<LI><B>MOTION DETECTOR AND COLLISION WARNING SYSTEM</B>:  500 ft (152.5 m)
range.
   Sounds an alarm and red light warns pilot of impending collision and/or

   field of vision.
<P>
<LI><B>HEAD SPOTLIGHTS</B>:  600 ft (182 m) range, normal light.
<P>
<LI><B>INFRARED SPOTLIGHT</B>:  2000 ft (609 m) range.  The infrared
spotlight sits in
   the front of the sensor head.  It emits an infrared light beam that is
   invisible to the normal eye.  However, an enemy with infrared optics can
   easily see the beam of light and track it to the Veritech.  Smoke impairs
   vision/beam.
<P>
<LI><B>THERMO-IMAGER</B>:  2000 ft (609 m) range.  A special optical heat
sensory unit
   that allows the infrared radiation of warm objects to be converted into a
   visible image.  It also enables the pilot to see in darkness, shadows and
   through smoke.
<P>
<LI><B>NIGHT VISION OPTICS</B>:  2000 ft (609 m) range.  An image
intensifier that is
   passive, meaning it emits no light of its own, but relies on ambient light
   which is electronically amplified to give a visible picture.  Night vision
   can not work in absolute darkness (but infrared can).
<P>
<LI><B>EXTERNAL AUDIO PICKUP</B>:  300 ft (91.5 m) range.  A sound
amplification
   listening system that can pick up a whisper 300 ft away.
<P>
<LI><B>EXTERNAL VIDEO SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM</B>:  600 ft (183 m) range.  A
video camera
   system with telescopic capabilities (8x magnification) is built into the
   head.  The video images can be relayed to a cockpit monitor and stored on
   removable video disks.  Maximum disk capacity is 24 hours.  Disks can be
   erased and reused.
<P>
<LI><B>EJECTOR SEAT</B>:  In case of an emergency, the pilot can be
instantly ejected.
   In battloid mode, the pilot is ejected out of the mecha's back.
<P>
<LI><B>CE-1 CYCLONE EJECTOR SYSTEM</B>:  Also in case of an emergency, the
VR-135
   Forager Cyclone will also be ejected from the doomed mecha.  This system is
   activated automatically when the pilot pulls the activation lever for his
   ejection seat.  The cyclone will deploy parachutes once outside of the
   mecha and then land within 1D6x1000 feet of the pilot.  This system was
   installed to allow pilots to retrieve their cyclones even after their
   veritechs had been destroyed.
<P>
<LI><B>SELF-DESTRUCT</B>:  A last ditch effort to prevent the capture of a
Veritech
   unit (usually preceded by the pilot's ejection from the Veritech) is self-
   destruction.  Explosive damage is fairly contained.  A VAF-9 Alpha without
   missiles (or few) does 2D6 x 10 M.D., but a Veritech with all or most of
   its missiles (35 or more) will do 2D6 x 100 M.D. to a 50 ft (15.2 m)
   radius.
<P>
<LI><B>SMOKE SCREEN SYSTEM</B>:  The VAF-9 Assault Alpha can emit a thick
cloud of
   smoke from its rear to create immediate cover.  The smoke screen system can
   discharge a maximum of 4 bursts before needing replacement (smoke missiles
   can be converted to function in the system).  Each burst will cover a 60 ft
   area (19.8 m).
<P>
<LI><B>HEAT AND RADIATION SHIELDS</B>:  Special shielding prevents the
penetration of
   life-threatening heat and radiation.
<P>
<LI><B>INDEPENDENT OXYGEN AND CIRCULATORY SYSTEM</B>: Built-in tanks
provide 48 hours
   of continuous oxygen.  A special recycling system can keep the air
   breathable for a maximum of one week.
<P>
<LI><B>SURVIVAL GEAR</B>: The VAF-9 includes a VR-135 Forager Cyclone, four
weeks'
   compact emergency rations, an emergency signal beacon, three first-aid
   kits, and a life raft.  There is space for an energy rifle to be attached
   to each ejector seat, and the pilot can of course carry a side-arm.
