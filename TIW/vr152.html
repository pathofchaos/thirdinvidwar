<H1>THE VR-152 BATTLER II</H1>
<IMG ALIGN=right BORDER=2 HSPACE=3 SRC="./Images/battler2.gif">
<H2>BACKGROUND</H2>
The VR-152 Battler II was the first new cyclone design produced after 
the Second Invid War.  Designed to be the new "Grunt" of the REF, this 
design sacrificed some of the Cyclone's fabled mobility for vast 
increases in armor and weaponry.  The Battler II is now the standard 
front-line fighting mecha for the REF, and is usually used either as 
support forces for Destroid and Hovertank units or independent heavy 
infantry platoons.  The Battler II is designed for the close assault 
ground combat that made up most of the land battles of the First Invid 
War.
<P>
The VR-152 Battler II cyclone is the largest and bulkiest of all 
cyclones, with the exception of the VR-112 Samson.  The cyclone itself 
is very boxy and angular, resembling the older VR-052 Battler cyclone.  
Battler II Pilots usually wear the heavier 
CVR-4C heavy combat armor instead of the standard CVR-4 armor, in 
anticipation of heavy hand-to-hand combat with enemy mecha.

<OL>
<LI>Depleting the M.D.C. of the Main Body will shut the mecha down 
    completely.
<LI>Depleting the M.D.C. of the body armor will destroy it and very likely 
    kill the wearer (10% chance of survival).
</OL>
The Second Generation Cyclones are equipped with laser resistant 
ceramic armor, so laser weapons do only HALF damage.  This does NOT 
include any other energy attacks such as particle beams or ion blasts, 
nor does it help against explosives.

<DT><B>Cargo:</B>  
<DD>The VR-152 has detachable cargo boxes that are connected to the 
rear of the bike like saddlebags.  The size of each container is 18 
inches tall by 20 inches wide by 18 inches deep.  A passenger can also 
ride seated behind the driver.  The VR-152 can hold 300 lbs (140 kg) in 
addition to the rider.  Reduce maximum speed by 20% for every additional 
50 lbs (22 kg) over the limit and add -1 to dodge.
<P>
Unlike its predecessors, the storage boxes of the new cyclones do NOT 
drop off when they convert to battloid mode.  Instead, the boxes are 
shifted to the lower back, just below the thruster packs and covering 
the butt of the pilot.  The passenger, however, isn't so lucky...
</DL>
<P>
<B>Main Engine:</B> FF-600 Fusion/Protoculture Engine
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Range:</B>
<DD> 2 protoculture cells will power the cyclone for approximately 12 
months before needing refueling.  The backup system can operate on 1 
protoculture cell for 6 months at no penalty.  Constant flying will 
drain the protoculture cells twice as quickly for all models.  As a 
final backup, the cyclone can run on fusion power alone for up to 400 
miles on a full tank of fuel, but maximum speed is reduced 15% and 
constant flying is impossible.  The fusion engine runs off hydrogen, so 
any hydrogen-rich liquid (like water or ammonia) can be used for fuel.  
Extra gas from the fusion engine is released through an exhaust port.
<P>
<DT><B>Color Scheme:</B>
<DD>Following the new painting scheme for most REF mecha, the 
new military cyclones are colored based on where they are stationed.  
Desert Cyclones are usually painted in a tan camouflage, Arctic Cyclones 
are painted a flat white, etc.  Most of the Battler IIs assigned to the 
Icarus Mission were painted an olive green and grey in color, though 
they are often repainted by resistance groups to match their terrain or 
tastes.  Each cyclone is streamlined in a color corresponding to the 
position of the pilot.  Enlisted Pilots have their cyclones streamlined 
in Blue, Aces and low-ranking Officers in Red, and Platoon Leaders in 
Green.

<H3>WEAPON SYSTEMS</H3>
<OL>
<LI><B>GR-103 MINI-MISSILE LAUNCHER (2)</B>.  The main weapon of older 
  cyclones has remained mostly unchanged in the newer models.  The launchers 
  have been updated with newer technology which makes them more  
  resilient to damage and easier to repair (+20% to repair rolls).  In 
  motorcycle mode, the two missile launchers are side by side in the 
  nose of the cycle.  In battloid mode, the missile launchers are 
  divided, with one on each shoulder of the mecha.  Both launchers hold 
  6 mini-missiles (usually armor-piercing).
  <P><UL>
  <LI><B>Primary Purpose</B>: Assault
  <LI><B>Secondary Purpose</B>: Anti-Aircraft, Anti-Mecha
  <LI><B>Missile Type</B>: Any type of REF Mini-missile EXCEPT Plasma.  
      Armor-piercing are standard-issue for the VR-152 Battler II. 
  <LI><B>Mega-Damage</B>: Varies with missile type.
  <LI><B>Rate of Fire</B>: One at a time or in volleys of two, four, six, or 
      all.  Remember, a volley counts as one melee attack regardless of the 
      number of missiles.
  <LI><B>Range</B>: Varies with missile type; 20 ft to 1 mile.
  <LI><B>Payload</B>: 6 missiles per each launcher, for a total capacity of 12.
  </UL><P>
<LI><B>GR-187 HIP MISSILE LAUNCHERS</B> (2).  A new addition to modern 
  cyclones, the VR-152 Battler II comes automatically equipped with a 
  pair of GR-187s.  These weapons are mounted on the hip/upper leg 
  shields in battloid mode and in the lower back of the cyclone in 
  motorcycle mode.  It appears as four small tubes built directly into 
  the armored plate.  The missiles can only fire in battloid mode.
  <P><UL>
  <LI><B>Primary Purpose</B>: Assault
  <LI><B>Secondary Purpose</B>: Anti-Aircraft, Anti-Mecha
  <LI><B>Missile Type</B>: Any type of REF Mini-missile EXCEPT Plasma.  
      Armor-piercing are standard-issue for the VR-152 Battler II. 
  <LI><B>Mega-Damage</B>: Varies with missile type.
  <LI><B>Rate of Fire</B>: One or two at a time.
  <LI><B>Range</B>: Varies with missile type; 20 ft to 1 mile.
  <LI><B>Payload</B>: 4 missiles per each launcher, for a total capacity of 8.
  </UL><P>
<LI><B>MODULAR WEAPON SYSTEMS</B>.  As with all REF Cyclones, the arm shields
  of the VR-152 Battler II are designed to interface with one of the GR-series
  weapon modules.  One weapon module can be mounted on each forearm shield, 
  and it is not necessary to mount the same modules on each shield.  The 
  Cyclone's onboard computer system will automatically recognize which weapon
  module is installed and adjust the HUD displays on the pilot's helmet 
  accordingly.  Any GR-series weapon module can be used.
  <P>
  Typical VR-152s are assigned two <A HREF="./cycloneweapons.html#gr200">
  GR-200 MISSILE LAUNCHER/BEAM CANNON</A> units, though different weapons
  may be assigned if necessary or desired.  Click <A HREF=
  "./cycloneweapons.html">HERE</A> for a complete listing of cyclone weapon
  modules.
  <P>
<LI><B>Hand-to-Hand Combat</B>.  Punch does 1D4 M.D.  Kick does 1D4 M.D. (The 
  VR-152 Battler II has an equivalent strength of PS 50)  Leap Kick 
  does 2D4 M.D.  Body Flip or Body Block does 1D4 M.D.
  <P>
<LI>Any type of hand-held weapon can be fired by the pilot while in 
  cyclone armor, including the new <A HREF="./ref-weapons.html#g1000">Gallant 
  1000 Multi-Weapon System</A>.  
  <P>
<LI>Any other cyclone weapon pod can be substituted for the GR-200, both 
  from the newer cyclone models and the older ones.
</OL>

<B>STANDARD SENSORS AND EQUIPMENT FOR ALL MILITARY CYCLONES</B>
<UL>

    and track up to 40 different targets.
<LI><B>TARGETING COMPUTER:</B> Uses helmet display instead of retractable sensor 
    of older models.  Provides the pilot with +3 to strike with missiles and 
    +2 to strike with other weapon systems (Beam Cannons, Lasers, etc.).  
    <B>Range:</B> 4000 ft (609 m).
<LI><B>RADIO COMMUNICATIONS:</B> Boosts standard radio in CVR-series armors to 
    10 mile (16 km) range.   
<LI><B>MISCELLANEOUS INDICATORS:</B> Altitude, Speed, Power status, Time, Date, 
      Direction, etc.  All controlled by on-board computer.
