<H2>BACKGROUND</H2>
The <B><I>Exeter</I>-class Escort</B> has perhaps the most intriguing
background of any capital ship class in the REF fleet.  Originally named the
<I>Ark Angel</I>-class, the escorts were built shortly after the first REF
engagement with the Invid over Tirol in 2022.  During this battle enormous
numbers of Invid mecha overwhelmed REF Veritech squadrons and did serious
damage to the <I>SDF-3 Pioneer</I> and other REF capital ships before being
forced to withdraw.  This near-defeat pointed out a fundamental flaw in the
REF's war strategy.  Based on their experiences with the Zentraedi the REF had
expected to encounter a large number of capital ships around Tirol and had
built up the expeditionary force fleet accordingly.  However, the forces of
the Invid Regent were based on hit-and-run tactics using large numbers of
smaller mecha such as Scouts and Troopers.  Unprepared for assaults by large
numbers of mecha, the REF fleet took heavy losses in the early battles of the
Sentinels War due to inadequate anti-mecha defenses.
<P>
The Ark Angel-class escorts were designed to counteract this weakness.  The
ship is armed with 40 retractable laser turrets and 8 retractable missile
turrets, double the anti-mecha defenses of larger capital ships such as the <A
HREF="warrior.html">Warrior-class destroyers</A> and the <A HREF="tokugawa.html">Tokugawa-class
cruisers</A>.  In addition, the escorts can carry four wings of Veritechs in their
enormous launching bays located on each wing.  Designed by the same engineers
who built the Horizont-class troop shuttles, the escorts have the same
graceful "flying swan" body style that makes them look too delicate for
warship duties.  However, the ships are surprisingly durable and, more
importantly, agile enough to surprise many mecha pilots.  The vessels are even
fold-capable, allowing them to keep up with large convoys and protect them
from Invid attacks.  The only glaring weakness of the class is that it lacks
heavy weaponry for ship-to-ship combat.  Aside from a single heavy laser, the
escort must rely on its fighter wings to protect itself from enemy warships.
<P>
The <I>RSS Ark Angel</I>, the prototype ship for the design, was the first
starship produced by the REF at the recently captured Tirolian shipyards. 
However, shortly after the warship's initial test flights were completed the
Ark Angel was hijacked by Colonel Jonathan Wolff and a group of officers and
crew loyal to Rick Hunter and the Sentinels, who were trapped on the dying
planet Praxis.  After Wolff rescued the Sentinels the freedom fighters
commandeered the ship and used it to defeat the Invid on Gaurda and Haydon IV.
 Following the Sentinels victory at Haydon the grateful Haydonites gave the
heroes the last surviving Haydonite cruiser, which Admiral Hunter ironically
decided to also name <I>Ark Angel</I>.  Both <I>Ark Angels</I> were used by
the Sentinels throughout the rest of the Sentinels War.  Unfortunately the
escort <I>Ark Angel</I> was destroyed above Optera during the final battle of
the war.
<P>
Eventually the charges against Jonathan Wolff and his associates for stealing
the original <I>Ark Angel</I> were dropped.  However, not wishing to glorify
the hijacking of one of their ships the REF decided to change the name of the
class to <I>Exeter</I>, which was the second escort produced at Tirol.  The
name <I>Ark Angel</I> was officially assigned to the Sentinels' haydonite
cruiser when it became part of the REF fleet in 2033.
<P>
Exeter-class escorts served as an important part of the REF fleet throughout
all three Invid wars.  The class was eventually retired in 2052, although
escorts continued to serve in the RGF fleet until the late 2070s.  Several
ships have been purchased by commercial interests and are now used as cargo
vessels, a job in which they perform extremely well since they have both space
fold and atmospheric re-entry capabilities.  Exeters were produced at the
Fantoma Orbiting Shipyards, Karbarran Space Works and Peryton IV Shipyards,
sometimes reaching production rates as high as 25 per year.

<B>NOTES:</B>
<OL>
<LI>Destroying the forward bridge will instantly kill anyone on the command
    deck.  However, there is an auxiliary bridge in the engineering section
    that the surviving crew can take command from.  If the main bridge is
    lost the ship will be operating at -2 initiative due to having to rely
    on backup systems.
<LI>Depleting the MDC of the forward command section or neck section will
    seriously impair (practically destroy) the ship.  (1D4x10)% of the crew
    will be killed, the main bridge will be lost (see above), the main 
    laser will be destroyed, and 16 concealed lasers and 2 concealed 
    missile launchers will be destroyed.  The surviving crew can effectively
    command the ship from the engineering section, but will be at -5 
    initiative and -2 to dodge due to severe systems damage.
<LI>Depleting the MDC of the main body/engineering section will eliminate the 
    escort.  All internal systems will shut down, including life support and 
    internal gravity.  In addition, there is a 40% chance that the power 
    systems will overload and the ship will explode, doing 1D6x1,000 M.D. to 
    everything in a 1,500 ft (458 m) radius.  Regardless of whether it 
    explodes or not, the ship itself will be an unsalvageable floating 
    wreck.
<LI>Destroying the flight deck nacelles will greatly impair the escort's 
    ability to deploy and recover mecha.  Under normal circumstances the 
    destroyer can launch or recover 8 mecha per nacelle, per turn.  For every 
    400 points of damage a flight deck takes reduce this number by 1.  If the 
    flight deck reaches 0 MDC then it is <I>destroyed</I>; no mecha can be 
    launched or recovered, (1D6x10)% of the flight crew will be killed, and 
    any mecha that have already been launched will need to find another place 
    to land.
<LI>Depleting the MDC of the main engines will force the ship to rely on its
    secondary engines.  Depleting the MDC of the main engines AND secondary
    engines will leave the ship adrift in space.  If in an atmosphere, the 
    ship will crash (destruction of the main engines will render the 
    antigravity system useless due to loss of power).  The wings do not 
    provide sufficient lift for the escort to attempt a controlled landing.
<LI>The Pinpoint Barriers regenerate at a rate of 1,250 MD per second (2,500
    MD per melee round).  If destroyed, a barrier will completely regenerate
    within four seconds (2 melee rounds).  See the <A HREF="#ppb">Pinpoint 
    Barrier System</A> entry for details.

<LI><B>RETRACTABLE LASER TURRETS (40):</B> The escort's main anti-mecha 
    weaponry consists of 40 retractable laser turrets mounted at various 
    strategic places along the hull.  These short-range are devastating 
    against mecha and can do moderate damage against any enemy spacecraft 
    that get too close.  When not in use gun turrets are concealed within the 
    hull underneath a sliding hatch.  At most 20 lasers can be brought to
    bear on a single target.

        first and attacking mecha/aircraft second.
    </UL><P>
<LI><B>RETRACTABLE MEDIUM MISSILE LAUNCHERS (8):</B> In addition to the 
    retractable lasers, the Exeter escorts carry eight medium range missile 
    launchers which are also intended for anti-mecha defense.  Each launcher 
    contains 10 missile tubes allowing volleys of up to 10 missiles to be 
    fired at a single target per launcher.  Once depleted, the missile 
    launchers are reloaded by an automated loading system that takes 15 
    seconds (one melee round) to reload all 10 missiles.  Armor-piercing 
    smart missiles are usually used to avoid chances of friendly fighters 
    being shot down by the missiles.

    </UL><P>
<LI><A NAME="ppb"><B>DS-1 PINPOINT BARRIER DEFENSE SYSTEM:</B></A> Originally 
    developed by Dr. Emil Lang onboard the SDF-1 during the First Robotech
    War, the Pinpoint Barrier System is a standard defense system on board
    most REF starships, including the <I>Exeter</I> escorts.  The system
    generates four small disc-shaped force fields that can be positioned
    anywhere along the ship to deflect missiles, energy beams or projectiles.
    Each pinpoint barrier is about 200 ft (61 m) in length and can absorb up
    to 5,000 MD in damage, which then regenerates within five seconds (3 melee
    attacks).  The barriers can also be layered on top of each other to 
    generate a field which provides 20,000 MDC and can even deflect heavy 
    particle beams (usually).
    <P>
    The four barriers are controlled by operators in the command tower of the
    carrier.  These operators are instructed to defend (1) the command 
    section, (2) main engines, (3) flight decks, and (4) engineering section, 
    in that order.  The operators primarily concentrate on defending the ship 
    against larger spacecraft and leave defense against mecha attacking the 
    destroyer to the Veritechs and retractable weapon systems.
    <P><UL>
    <LI><B>PRIMARY PURPOSE:</B> Defense (the pinpoint barrier system cannot be
        used as a weapon)
    <LI><B>RANGE:</B> Up to 100 feet (30.5 m) from the surface of the vessel.
    <LI><B>DAMAGE CAPACITY:</B> Can sustain up to 5,000 MD per round. 
        Regenerates at a rate of 2,500 MD per melee round.
    <LI><B>RADIUS:</B> 200 ft (61 m)
    <LI><B>DEFENSIVE MOVEMENT:</B> Can move from one end of the destroyer to 
        the other in less than a single round.  Trained operators can attempt 
        to block attacks up to 8 times per melee (counts as a parry) and are 
        at +7 to block.  Untrained characters can parry up to their number of 
        hand-to-hand attacks with their normal parry bonuses only.
    <LI><B>PAYLOAD:</B> Nearly inexhaustible.  Will work as long as system is 
        functional (see below) and engines are intact.  If main engines are
        destroyed, the barrier will loose power and not function.
    <LI><B>NOTE:</B> If all four barriers are grouped in a single spot they
        can deflect a heavy particle beam attack, such as the one generated 
        by Zentraedi or Robotech Master warships.  However, the beam will 
        completely destroy all four barriers and put incredible strain on the 
        pinpoint barrier system to the point where it may short out.  After 
        deflecting an energy beam, roll percentile dice on the table below to 
        determine additional effects/damage.

    </UL></UL></OL>
<P>
<H3>SYSTEMS OF NOTE:</H3>
<UL>
<LI><B>ANTIGRAVITY PROPULSION SYSTEM:</B> The Exeter escorts are
equipped with an anti-gravity propulsion system used for planetary landings
and liftoffs.  The system is good for vertical ascent/descent only and can
lift the ship at speeds of up to 1,320 feet (400 m) per minute.  The system
will function so long as the main engines can supply energy to it.
<LI><B>HYPERSPACE COMMUNICATIONS:</B> The escort is equipped with a
hyperspace communications relay which allows faster-than-light communication
between the ships and other vessels or planetary bases.  Hyperspace
communications are still not instantaneous, however.  Audio/video
communication travels through hyperspace at a rate of about 5 seconds per
light year, so messages communicated over vast distances can still take days,
weeks, or months to arrive.
<LI><B>LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEMS:</B> The Exeter destroyers have sufficient life
support to provide breathable air and comfortable temperatures for 500
people for up to 15 years (air is recycled).  In an emergency the life support
system can support up to 800 people at one time, though living conditions
onboard will get extremely cramped at that point.  The carrier also holds
sufficient food and water to support 400 people for up to 6 months.
<LI><B>LONG-RANGE LASER/SATELLITE RELAY COMMUNICATIONS:</B> The communications
array of the escort can communicate with up to 500 craft simultaneously at
ranges of up to 600 miles (960 km).  This range can be boosted indefinitely by
using satellites or other spacecraft to relay communications.
<LI><B>LONG-RANGE RADAR:</B> The radar array of the Exeter can track and
identify up to 500 craft simultaneously.  The radar system has a 
600 mile/960 km range.
<LI><B>SPACE FOLD SYSTEM:</B> For FTL propulsion the escort is
equipped with a fold drive, capable of propelling the ship through hyperspace
at speeds up to 3.28x10^10 mps (5.25x10^10 kmps), or 1 light year per 6
minutes.  When executing a space fold the Exeter will transport any ships
within a 1 mile (1.6 km) radius with it, allowing it to transport up to about
a dozen smaller ships with it, if necessary.  The range of the fold drive is
theoretically unlimited except by the life expectancy of the spacecraft.
<LI><B>SUBLIGHT ENGINES:</B> As a backup to the Fold System, the escort
is equipped with sublight engines that can propel the ship at speeds up to
0.24 speed of light (38,400 miles/61,800 km per second) in space.  Note that
these engines are mainly intended for rapid movement inside a planetary system
and are not suited for long voyages between star systems.  In a planetary
atmosphere the carrier is limited to speeds of Mach 2 at low altitudes or Mach
5 at high altitudes due to hull stress.
<LI><B>SUBSPACE MASS SENSORS:</B> The Exeter is equipped with subspace sensors
which are based on the same principles as the hyperspace communications array.
 These sensors can essentially instantly detect mass readings and movement of
objects up to 1 AU (93 million miles) distant from the ship, and the readings
are used both for early warning and for navigation when travelling at sublight
speeds.  Readings taken with the subspace sensors are not very detailed (-25%
penalty when trying to identify a detected object) and cannot detect objects
of less than 60,000 kg (this includes most mecha).
</UL>
<P>
<H3>MECHA COMPLEMENT:</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Each landing bay nacelle can hold and support up to 24 veritechs/destroids of
any type (48 total), as long as the mecha are smaller than 50 ft (15.2 m) and
weigh less than 40 tons each.  Destroids are rare on Exeter escorts since they
are usually restricted to space duties, however the final mecha breakdown
depends on the mission.  A typical mecha complement for an Exeter will
include:
<UL>
<LI>24 Alpha Veritechs (VAF-6 or <A HREF="./vaf8.html">VAF-8</A>)
<LI>12 Beta Veritechs (VBF-1 or <A HREF="./vbf2.html">VBF-2</A>)
