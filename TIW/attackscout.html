<H1>THE INVID ATTACK SCOUT</H1>
<H2>BACKGROUND</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=236 HEIGHT=347 BORDER=2 HSPACE=3 
 SRC="./Images/attackscout.gif">
The Attack Scout first appeared in late 2043 in the skies over North
America, but soon spread to areas throughout the globe.  This new 
high-speed mecha quickly became a feared aerial combatant, as it was faster
and more maneuverable than a VAF-6 Alpha Fighter.  The design also had 
heavier armor and more powerful plasma cannons than its predecessors, making 
it an even more dangerous threat to older REF mecha.  By the winter of 2043 
the Attack Scout became the most common Invid mecha around, constantly 
conducting high-speed patrols in search of resistance fighters.
<P>
At first appearance, the Attack Scout looks very similar to the old
Armored Scout.  However, a close examination will reveal many
differences.  The upper body of the mecha is a single super-hard metal
plate that curves around the rear of the mecha and ends about halfway
underneath it.  There is a single slit in the rear of this plate where
the main engine thruster is located.  The engine itself seems to be a
combination thruster/antigravity unit.  It is tremendously efficient,
allowing the Attack Scout to achieve very high speeds with little
thrust.  The sensor eye is identical to the old Scout, but new plasma
cannons are located on either side of it, just under the edge of the
plate.  The forearm shields of the mecha are much larger, though the
legs are skinnier.  The Attack Scout is red in color, just like its
cousins.
<P>
The most unique feature about the new scout is that it can "convert"
into a special configuration for high-speed aerial attacks.  The legs
fold into the main body and the claw units retract into the forearm
shields.  The scout then pulls up its forearm shields, completely
covering the legs and weak areas on the lower front main body.  At this
point the scout looks like a jet-propelled arrow head.  By rotating the
forearm shields down slightly the scout can form a small "gunsight" in
the front of the armor, allowing the Invid to use its protoculture
sensor and plasma cannons.  (The effect is something like a cartoon
oyster opening its shell slightly to peek outside)  The shields can
quickly rotate back to protect these vulnerable systems if necessary.
<P>
Attack Scouts are NEVER encountered alone.  The smallest number they are
ever found in is a trio, though they can often be encountered in FAR
greater numbers.  The scout is much weaker on the ground, so if it is
ever necessary for a patrol to investigate something on land, ONE mecha
will descend and look around while the other two remain in the air to
cover it.  The landed scout will quickly take off if it is attacked or
startled.  Attack Scouts will seldom explore caves or underground
structures.  They will instead call in a patrol of 
<A HREF="./invidsentinel.html">Invid Sentinels</A> to investigate while 
they remain above to attack anyone who emerges.

<B>Notes:</B>
<DL>
<DT>+
<DD> These areas are fully protected when the mecha is flying (the
     forearm shields are pulled in and form a flush surface with the
     upper main body).  If the Invid lowers the forearms to fire at an
     enemy or simply take a quick look around, then the beam cannons and
     the sensor eye may be targeted, but this is an <B>EXTREMELY</B> difficult
     shot; -5 to strike in addition to normal penalties.
<DT>*
<DD> The sensor eye is the most vulnerable place on the Invid's mecha
     body.  Destruction of the sensor eye will kill/destroy the mecha
     and pilot (goes right through crew compartment).  However, it is a
     small target protected by surrounding shielding, thus, to hit it
     the player/character must make a called shot and is at -3 to
     strike.
<DT>**
<DD> Depleting the M.D.C. of the lower front main body will shut the
     mecha down completely.  Depleting the lower front main body M.D.C.
     and crew compartment M.D.C. will blow the Invid to pieces.
<DT>***
<DD> Depleting the M.D.C. of the upper/rear main body will NOT shut the
     mecha down.  Instead, any damage to the main body will go directly
     to the pilot's compartment. (!!)  Once the pilot's compartment is
     destroyed the mecha will effectively be dead.
<DT>&amp;
<DD> The Main Engine Thruster is NOT protected by the Upper Main Body
     and is thus always vulnerable to attack.  However, the engine is
     recessed into the mecha, so the only way to hit it is to make a
     called shot <B>AS THE MECHA PASSES!</B>  -4 to strike in addition to
     normal penalties.

<H3>SPECIFICATIONS</H3>
<DL>
<DT><B>Flight:</B>
<DD>Stationary hover to 4690 mph (Mach 7.0) maximum, making the
  attack scout effectively transatmospheric (able to blast into
  outer space under its own power).  However, at speeds greater
  than Mach 4.0 (2680 mph) the mecha becomes effectively
  unmaneuverable and can only travel in a straight line (-3 to
  hit due to speed, but the Invid cannot dodge).  Cruising speed
  for reconnaissance is 120 to 300 mph (192 to 480 kmph).
<DT><B>Running:</B>
<DD>30 mph (48 kmph).  Rarely runs.
<DT><B>Jumping:</B>

<H3>WEAPON SYSTEMS</H3>
<OL>
<LI><B>DUAL PULSE BEAM CANNONS</B>.  Two small Invid beam cannons are mounted 
   in the main body of the mecha, just to either side of the sensor eye.
   The weapons are fixed forward, but the inner nozzle of each cannon
   can rotate to a maximum of 30 degrees in any direction.  Though both
   cannons fire in unison, one cannon will still function if the other
   is destroyed.
   <P>
   These weapons are blocked and cannot when the forearm shields are
   retracted.  However, the Invid can "crack" the shields by leaning
   them down slightly, forming a gap large enough to fire through.<P>
   <UL>
   <LI><B>Primary Purpose</B>: Assault
   <LI><B>Range</B>: 5000 ft (1500 m)
   <LI><B>Damage</B>: One single blast (rare) does 2D6 M.D., dual blasts
     (simultaneous shots, same target) do 4D6 M.D. and a burst (6
     blasts, all at same target) does 6D6 M.D.
   <LI><B>Rate of Fire</B>: Four attacks per melee.  Dual blasts and bursts 
     both count as ONE attack.
   <LI><B>Payload</B>: Unlimited
   <LI><B>Bonuses to Strike</B>: +1 to strike, plus protoculture targeting 
     bonuses.
   </UL><P>
<LI><B>HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT</B>.  The Attack Scout can engage in hand-to-hand
   combat if necessary.  This is rare, though, as the Invid must lower
   its forearm shields in order to strike.<P>
   <UL>
   <LI><B>Attacks Per Melee</B>: 4
   <LI><B>Hand to Hand Bonuses</B>: +1 to strike, +3 to parry, +1 to dodge on 
     the ground, +5 to dodge in flight, +7 to dodge at speeds between Mach
     3 and Mach 4, +1 to roll with impact.
   </UL><P>
<LI><B>RAMMING ATTACK</B>.  The Attack Scout will sometimes launch a "suicide"
   attack on an enemy by accelerating as fast as possible and then
   ramming the enemy mecha.  This attack is especially likely if the
   scout is badly damaged or surrounded, with no chance of escape.  This
   attack is very likely to destroy the scout as well, so it is usually
   used only in desperation.<P>
   <UL>
   <LI><B>Bonuses to Strike</B>: +2
   <LI><B>Damage</B>: 1D4x100 M.D. (!!) to the target.  The <B>SAME</B> amount
     of damage is inflicted on the upper main body of the scout.  The scout is
     automatically destroyed if it receives 200 M.D. or more of damage.
