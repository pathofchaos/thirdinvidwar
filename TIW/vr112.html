<H1>THE VR-112 SAMSON</H1>
<H2>BACKGROUND</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=right WIDTH=183 HEIGHT=311 SRC="./Images/samson.gif">
The VR-112 Samson was the first cyclone designed with a non-combat role in
mind.  During the Cyclone Redesign Project of 2039, the REF engineering team
reasoned that a small man-sized mecha such as the cyclone could have many
logistics and utilitarian uses aside from combat, such as moving supplies,
arming veritechs and destroids with heavy ordinance, and helping in combat
engineering tasks such as building bridges or planting explosives.  They
therefore designed the Samson to be a "light" engineering vehicle for use by
REF support forces and combat engineers.  VR-112 cyclones are most commonly
found in REF starships or REF bases helping with the general maintenance and
repair of other mecha.  They are also sometimes used in the field by REF
Combat Engineers to help perform their tasks.
<P>
The VR-112 Samson is the most massive cyclone designed to date, mostly due to
the extensive hydraulic systems that give the battlesuit its great strength. 
While the Samson is immensely strong and well armored (due to its bulk), it is
also the slowest of all cyclones.  In cyclone mode, the VR-112 is very
angular, and so large that it resembles a piece of machinery more than it does
a motorcycle.  In battloid mode the massive exoskeleton arms have led to the
model being nicknamed "Ahnold" by several different construction platoons. 
The VR-112 is painted gray with yellow warning markings, and is often battered
and scraped.  Since the VR-112 rarely goes into combat, most pilots wear the
older CVR-3 body armor.
<P>
Following the end of the Third Invid War most of the design team that worked
on the VR-112 retired from the REF and started their own construction mecha
company, ironically named <I>Samson Industries</I> and based on Tirol. 
Although the company specializes in cheaper powered suits and
non-transformable mecha, they have produced two successor cyclones to the
VR-112 Samson (the <B>VR-119/SCE-02 Samson II</B> and the <B>SCE-06
Hercules</B>), both of which are sold commercially to the RGF and civilian
construction companies.  The original VR-112 Samson is still very common on
Earth, as it was imported in great number during the Era of Rebuilding (2048-2055).

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>NOTE:</B> By 2037 the REF Command had repealed the old RDF rules forbidding
mecha engineers from receiving mecha pilot training.  It is now standard
practice for all REF Bio-Maintenance Engineers and Combat Engineers to receive
pilot training on Cyclones with emphasis on the VR-112 Samson.  Mecha combat
skill is still limited to BASIC level, however; one cannot learn to be an ace
pilot and crack mechanic in the academy at the same time.

The Second Generation Cyclones are equipped with laser resistant 
ceramic armor, so laser weapons do only HALF damage.  This does NOT 
include any other energy attacks such as particle beams or ion blasts, 
nor does it help against explosives.

<DD>The VR-112 has a variety of holding pouches and connectors in addition to
detachable saddlebags that are used for holding construction materials and
equipment.  The saddlebags are 18 inches tall by 20 inches wide by 18 inches
deep.  A passenger can also ride seated behind the driver, provided large
objects such as girders or panels are not being carried.  The enormously
strong VR-112 can hold up to 1500 lbs (675 kg) of material when properly
secured.  Reduce maximum speed by 20% for every additional 100 lbs (44 kg)
over the limit and add -1 to dodge.
<P>
Unlike its predecessors, the storage boxes of the new cyclones do NOT drop off
when they convert to battloid mode.  Instead, the boxes are shifted to the
lower back, just below the thruster packs and covering the butt of the pilot. 
The passenger, however, isn't so lucky...
</DL>
<P>
<B>Main Engine:</B> FF-650 Fusion/Protoculture Engines (2)
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Range:</B>
<DD> 4 protoculture cells will power the VR-112 for approximately 12 months
before needing refueling.  The backup system can operate on 2 protoculture
cells for 6 months at no penalty.  Constant flying will drain the protoculture
cells twice as quickly for all models.  As a final backup, the cyclone can run
on fusion power alone for up to 200 miles on a full tank of fuel, but maximum
speed is reduced 15% and constant flying is impossible.  The fusion engines
runs off hydrogen, so any hydrogen-rich liquid (like water or ammonia) can be
used for fuel.  Extra gas from the fusion engines are released through an
exhaust port.
<P>
<DT><B>Color Scheme:</B>
<DD>Standard VR-112 Samson cyclones are painted gray with yellow stripes and
trim, similar to modern construction equipment.  However, Samsons assigned to
combat units are usually colored based on where they are stationed; desert
Samsons are usually painted in a tan camouflage, arctic Samsons are painted a
flat white, etc.  But since the Samsons assigned to the Icarus Mission were
not intended for combat duty, most of them retained their gray and yellow
color schemes.  Unlike the military Cyclones, Samsons are not streamlined in
colors corresponding to the ranks of their pilots.

<H3>WEAPON SYSTEMS</H3>
<OL>
<LI><B>WELDING LASER</B>. The VR-112 comes standardly equipped with a welding 
    laser on the right arm shield.  While not intended to be used as a weapon,

    it can do damage on higher settings.  <I>This welding laser is built into 
    the right arm shield and cannot be exchanged for another arm weapon!</I> 
    <P><UL>
    <LI><B>Primary Purpose</B>: Construction
    <LI><B>Mega-Damage Settings</B>: 1D4, 1D6, and 2D4 M.D. (Maximum Setting)
    <LI><B>S.D.C. Damage Settings</B>: 1D6, 3D6, 6D6, 1D6x10 S.D.C.
    <LI><B>Rate of Fire</B>: Standard.  
    <LI><B>Range</B>: 5 ft (1.5 m).
    <LI><B>Payload</B>: The welding laser draws power directly from the 
        on-board fusion reactors, so it is effectively unlimited as long as it

        remains attached to the cyclone.  The laser is useless if detached.
    </UL><P>
<LI><B>SPECIAL ADDITIONS</B>. The left arm shield of the VR-112 Samson can be 
  equipped with a variety of tools for special jobs, such as salvage, 
  demolition, sandblasting, etc.  These tools are designed specifically for 
  the VR-112 Samson and cannot be used with other cyclone designs.  Some of 
  the tools (and this is by no means a complete list) include:

  Gamemasters, feel free to come up with your own additions!<P>
<LI><B>MODULAR WEAPON SYSTEMS</B>. The left arm shield can also accept any 
    other GR-series weapon pod, both from the newer combat cyclone models and 
    the older ones.  Combat pods are usually mounted only when the mecha is 
    operating in battlefields or other "hot" zones.  Click <A HREF=

    modules.  The VR-112 is not equipped with a combat computer, so any 
    bonuses for certain weapon systems <B>do NOT apply</B> when being used on 
    the Samson.<P>
<LI><B>Hand-to-Hand Combat</B>.  Punch does 2D6 M.D.  Kick does 2D6 M.D. (The 
  VR-112 Samson has an equivalent strength of PS 150!)  Leap Kick 
  does 3D6 M.D.  Body Flip or Body Block does 2D6 M.D.
