<H1>THE VR-141 SUPER SABER</H1>
<IMG ALIGN=right BORDER=2 HSPACE=3 SRC="./Images/supersaber.gif">
<H2>BACKGROUND</H2>
The VR-141 Super Saber was designed by REF engineers at the request from REF 
Intelligence for a special cyclone unit for espionage and sabotage operations.
Especially designed for intelligence gathering, the new cyclone includes 
advanced sensor systems and a powerful computer for data analysis.  For 
weaponry, the engineers decided to stick with a modified version of the 
CADS-1 close assault system that was so successful on the old VR-041 Saber 
cyclones.  The new CADS-2 system had multiple spinning blades that act as 
both a shield and a buzzsaw in combat.  One REF General pointed out that the 
lack of energy weapons could become a serious liability in the field, so the 
designers grudgingly came up with the CADS-1B, a smaller version of the 
original CADS-1 mated to a laser.  Both designs were well-received by the REF 
Intelligence community.
<P>
The VR-141 Super Saber closely resembles its predecessor, the VR-041 Saber 
Cyclone, with the same smooth lines and curved nose, and the distinctive 
round CADS units on the front wheel hub.  A closer look will reveal that the 
new VR-141 is slightly larger and better equipped than its predecessor, 
though.  Super Saber Pilots usually wear the standard CVR-4 body armor.

<B>NOTES:</B>
<OL>
<LI>Depleting the M.D.C. of the Main Body will shut the mecha down 
    completely.
<LI>Depleting the M.D.C. of the body armor will destroy it and very likely 
    kill the wearer (10% chance of survival).
</OL>
The Second Generation Cyclones are equipped with laser resistant 
ceramic armor, so laser weapons do only HALF damage.  This does NOT 
include any other energy attacks such as particle beams or ion blasts, 
nor does it help against explosives.
<P>
CVR-4C Heavy Armor is incompatible with the VR-141 Super Saber.

<DL>
<DT><B>Cargo:</B>  
<DD>The VR-141 has detachable cargo boxes that are connected to the 
rear of the bike like saddlebags.  The size of each container is 18 
inches tall by 20 inches wide by 18 inches deep.  A passenger can also 
ride seated behind the driver.  The VR-141 can hold 300 lbs (140 kg) in 
addition to the rider.  Reduce maximum speed by 20% for every additional 
50 lbs (22 kg) over the limit and add -1 to dodge.
<P>
Unlike its predecessors, the storage boxes of the new cyclones do NOT 
drop off when they convert to battloid mode.  Instead, the boxes are 
shifted to the lower back, just below the thruster packs and covering 
the butt of the pilot.  The passenger, however, isn't so lucky...
<P>
Note that usually one of the saddlebags is replaced with a Comptech A-4
Portable Computer. (see below)
</DL>
<P>
<B>Main Engine:</B> FF-600 Fusion/Protoculture Engine
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Range:</B>
<DD> 2 protoculture cells will power the cyclone for approximately 12 
months before needing refueling.  The backup system can operate on 1 
protoculture cell for 6 months at no penalty.  Constant flying will 
drain the protoculture cells twice as quickly for all models.  As a 
final backup, the cyclone can run on fusion power alone for up to 400 
miles on a full tank of fuel, but maximum speed is reduced 15% and 
constant flying is impossible.  The fusion engine runs off hydrogen, so 
any hydrogen-rich liquid (like water or ammonia) can be used for fuel.  
Extra gas from the fusion engine is released through an exhaust port.
<P>
<DT><B>Color Scheme:</B>
<DD>Following the new painting scheme for most REF mecha, the 
new military cyclones are colored based on where they are stationed.  
Desert Cyclones are usually painted in a tan camouflage, Arctic Cyclones 
are painted a flat white, etc.  Most of the Super Sabers assigned to the 
Icarus Mission were painted dark blue and battleship grey in color, though 
they are often repainted by resistance groups to match their terrain or 
tastes.  Each cyclone is streamlined in a color corresponding to the 
position of the pilot.  Enlisted Pilots have their cyclones streamlined 
in Blue, Aces and low-ranking Officers in Red, and Platoon Leaders in 
Green.

<H3>WEAPON SYSTEMS</H3>
<OL>
<LI><B>GR-103 MINI-MISSILE LAUNCHER (2)</B>.  The main weapon of older 
  cyclones has remained mostly unchanged in the newer models.  The launchers 
  have been updated with newer technology which makes them more  
  resilient to damage and easier to repair (+20% to repair rolls).  In 
  motorcycle mode, the two missile launchers are side by side in the 
  nose of the cycle.  In battloid mode, the missile launchers are 
  divided, with one on each shoulder of the mecha.  Both launchers hold 
  6 mini-missiles (usually armor-piercing).
  <P><UL>
  <LI><B>Primary Purpose</B>: Assault
  <LI><B>Secondary Purpose</B>: Anti-Aircraft, Anti-Mecha
  <LI><B>Missile Type</B>: Any type of REF Mini-missile EXCEPT Plasma.  
      Armor-piercing are standard-issue for the VR-141 Super Saber.
  <LI><B>Mega-Damage</B>: Varies with missile type.
  <LI><B>Rate of Fire</B>: One at a time or in volleys of two, four, six, or 
      all.  Remember, a volley counts as one melee attack regardless of the 
      number of missiles.
  <LI><B>Range</B>: Varies with missile type; 20 ft to 1 mile.
  <LI><B>Payload</B>: 6 missiles per each launcher, for a total capacity of 12.
  </UL><P>


<LI><B>GR-187 HIP MISSILE LAUNCHERS</B> (2).  A new addition to modern 
  cyclones, the VR-141 Super Saber comes automatically equipped with a 
  pair of GR-187s.  These weapons are mounted on the hip/upper leg 
  shields in battloid mode and in the lower back of the cyclone in 
  motorcycle mode.  It appears as four small tubes built directly into 
  the armored plate.  The missiles can only fire in battloid mode.
  <P><UL>
  <LI><B>Primary Purpose</B>: Assault
  <LI><B>Secondary Purpose</B>: Anti-Aircraft, Anti-Mecha
  <LI><B>Missile Type</B>: Any type of REF Mini-missile EXCEPT Plasma.  
      High explosive are standard-issue for the VR-141 Super Saber.
  <LI><B>Mega-Damage</B>: Varies with missile type.
  <LI><B>Rate of Fire</B>: One or two at a time.
  <LI><B>Range</B>: Varies with missile type; 20 ft to 1 mile.
  <LI><B>Payload</B>: 4 missiles per each launcher, for a total capacity of 8.
  </UL><P>
<LI><B>MODULAR WEAPON SYSTEMS</B>.  As with all REF Cyclones, the arm shields
  of the VR-141 Super Saber are designed to interface with one of the GR-series
  weapon modules.  One weapon module can be mounted on each forearm shield, 
  and it is not necessary to mount the same modules on each shield.  The 
  Cyclone's onboard computer system will automatically recognize which weapon
  module is installed and adjust the HUD displays on the pilot's helmet 
  accordingly.  Any GR-series weapon module can be used.
  <P>
  Typical VR-141s are assigned either two 
  <A HREF="./cycloneweapons.html#cads2">CADS-2 Melee Units</A> units, two 
  <A HREF="./cycloneweapons.html#cads1b">CADS-1B Melee Weapon/Laser units</A>, 
  or one CADS-2 and one CADS-1B.  Of course, different weapons may be assigned 
  if necessary or desired.  Click <A HREF="./cycloneweapons.html">HERE</A> 
  for a complete listing of cyclone weapon modules.
  <P>
<LI><B>COMPTECH A-4 PORTABLE COMPUTER</B>.  Usually one of the carrying bags 
  on the VR-141 will be replaced with this extremely powerful portable 
  computer.  Ideal for espionage, this computer can double as an audio/video 
  recorder and may be programmed with a variety of counterintelligence 
  programs.  The optical storage drive in the computer can record up to 6 
  hours of video and audio signal, 24 hours of audio-only signal, or 200 
  Gigabytes worth of computer information.  
  <P>
  <B>GAME EFFECTS</B>: In addition to its recording capabilities, the 
  Computer provides the character with a skills pool of +30%, which can be 
  split up any way desired; +30% for one skill, +15% for two skills, +10% for 
  three skills, etc.  Changing the computer's configuration requires a 
  skilled Computer Programmer or Hacker, and 1D6+1 hours of uninterrupted 
  work.  
  <P>
<LI><B>Hand-to-Hand Combat</B>.  Punch does 1D4 M.D.  Kick does 1D4 M.D. (The 
  VR-152 Battler II has an equivalent strength of PS 50)  Leap Kick 
  does 2D4 M.D.  Body Flip or Body Block does 1D4 M.D.
  <P>
<LI>Any type of hand-held weapon can be fired by the pilot while in 
  cyclone armor, including the new <A HREF="./ref-weapons.html#g1000">Gallant 
  1000 Multi-Weapon System</A>.
