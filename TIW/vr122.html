<H1>THE VR-122 PROTECTOR</H1>
<H2>BACKGROUND</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=right WIDTH=216 HEIGHT=264 SRC="./Images/protector.gif">
The VR-122 Protector security cyclone is yet a third support cyclone, this
time designed at the request of the <A HREF="newOCCs.html#police">REF Military 
Police</A>.  The MP wanted a stronger version of the VR-120 Ferret that could 
stand up to larger mecha and
tougher opponents, yet still be cheaply produced in mass numbers.  This mecha
would be ideal for helping to maintain order on REF bases and starships, as
well as to help occupy enemy population centers and maintain law and order
under martial law situations.  The cyclone had to be larger and slightly more
imposing than the VR-120, so as to help the police establish a psychological
advantage over would-be rebels and troublemakers.  The VR-122 Protector was
thus designed to fill this role.  While not intended to go head-to-head with
heavy combat mecha, the Protector is ideal for quick-strike attacks and can
keep a larger opponent occupied until heavier forces can arrive .  The
Protector also functions admirably in urban and intra-spaceship combat, using
its mobility to maximum advantage in the labyrinth of corridors and city
streets.  A sizeable number of VR-122s were included in the Icarus mission and
were intended to help establish a stable base of operations on Earth during
the Third Invid War, but events of the war never permitted such a base to be
established.  Furthermore, the transport ship containing the bulk of the
Protectors was destroyed early during the Third Invid War by Invid Space
Troopers.  Consequently, few Protectors saw action on Earth during the war,
though those few who made it performed well in guerrilla warfare against the
Invid.
<P>
The VR-122 Protector resembles the VR-041 Saber with its curved nose and
streamlined profile.  The cyclone is not equipped with the CADS systems,
however, instead mounting the new GR-220 Beam Cannon/SMG weapon units.  The
VR-122 is almost always painted dark blue and grey, and has varius military
police identification stenciled over it in light grey along with flashing red
and blue emergency lights on the front.  Protector pilots wear CVR-4 body
armor painted dark blue with "Military Police" stenciled across the back and
"MP" on the shoulders.
<P>
When the REF cyclone design team left the military to form <I>Samson
Industries</I> after the end of the Third Invid War, they were initially barred
from producing VR-122 Protectors by the REF due to concerns over sensitive
military technology used in its design.  After a long court battle Samson
Industries was eventually given permission to market the design to civilian law
enforcement agencies under the designation <B>SCE-04 Watchman</B> in 2050. 
The REF also kept control of the design as well, and RGF Intelligence and RGF
Security later used the design as a basis for their <B>VR-224 Guardsman</B>
cyclone in 2056.  Both the VR-122 Protector and the SCE-04 Watchman are quite
common on Earth and are standard issue for most police forces in major cities.

<OL>
<LI>Depleting the M.D.C. of the Main Body will shut the mecha down 
    completely.
<LI>Depleting the M.D.C. of the body armor will destroy it and very likely 
    kill the wearer (10% chance of survival).
</OL>
The Second Generation Cyclones are equipped with laser resistant 
ceramic armor, so laser weapons do only HALF damage.  This does NOT 
include any other energy attacks such as particle beams or ion blasts, 
nor does it help against explosives.
<P>
CVR-4C Heavy Armor is incompatible with the VR-122 Protector.

<DL>
<DD>The VR-122 has detachable cargo boxes that are connected to the 
rear of the bike like saddlebags.  The size of each container is 18 
inches tall by 20 inches wide by 18 inches deep.  The VR-122 can hold 250 lbs 
(105 kg) in addition to the rider. Reduce maximum speed by 20% for every 
additional 25 lbs (11 kg) over the limit and add -1 to dodge. 
<P>
Unlike its predecessors, the storage boxes of the new cyclones do NOT 
drop off when they convert to battloid mode.  Instead, the boxes are 
shifted to the lower back, just below the thruster packs and covering 
the butt of the pilot.  The passenger, however, isn't so lucky.
</DL>
<P>
<B>Main Engine:</B> FF-600 Fusion/Protoculture Engine
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Range:</B>
<DD> 2 protoculture cells will power the cyclone for approximately 12 
months before needing refueling.  The backup system can operate on 1 
protoculture cell for 6 months at no penalty.  Constant flying will 
drain the protoculture cells twice as quickly for all models.  As a 
final backup, the cyclone can run on fusion power alone for up to 400 
miles on a full tank of fuel, but maximum speed is reduced 15% and 
constant flying is impossible.  The fusion engine runs off hydrogen, so 
any hydrogen-rich liquid (like water or ammonia) can be used for fuel.  
Extra gas from the fusion engine is released through an exhaust port.
<P>
<DT><B>Color Scheme:</B>
<DD>The standard color scheme for the VR-122 Protector is dark blue and grey,
with light grey trim and stenciling.  Since Protectors are rarely stationed
outside of a city, base, or spaceship, these colors are rarely varied
according to terrain.  Occasionally a VR-122 that is assigned to field duty
will be repainted in a camouflage patteren matching where they are stationed
(Desert Cyclones are usually painted in a tan camouflage, Arctic Cyclones are
painted a flat white, etc.).
</DL>
<P>
<H3>WEAPON SYSTEMS</H3>
<OL>
<LI><B>GR-103 MINI-MISSILE LAUNCHER (2)</B>.  Like standard military cyclones,
  the VR-122 uses the GR-103 missile system as its main weapon.  The launchers
  have been updated with newer technology which makes them more  
  resilient to damage and easier to repair (+20% to repair rolls).  In 
  motorcycle mode, the two missile launchers are side by side in the 
  nose of the cycle.  In battloid mode, the missile launchers are 
  divided, with one on each shoulder of the mecha.  Both launchers hold 
  6 mini-missiles.  The Protector is usually equippped with an even mix of 
  high explosive and tear gas missiles.
  <P><UL>
  <LI><B>Primary Purpose</B>: Assault
  <LI><B>Secondary Purpose</B>: Anti-vehicle
  <LI><B>Missile Type</B>: Any type of REF Mini-missile EXCEPT Plasma.  
      High explosive and tear gas are standard-issue for the VR-122 
      Protector
  <LI><B>Mega-Damage</B>: Varies with missile type.
  <LI><B>Rate of Fire</B>: One at a time or in volleys of two, four, six, or 
      all.  Remember, a volley counts as one melee attack regardless of the 
      number of missiles.
  <LI><B>Range</B>: Varies with missile type; 20 ft to 1 mile.
  <LI><B>Payload</B>: 6 missiles per each launcher, for a total capacity of
12.
  </UL><P>
<LI><B>GR-187 HIP MISSILE LAUNCHERS</B> (2).  A new addition to modern
  cyclones, the VR-122 Protector comes automatically equipped with a
  pair of GR-187 missile launchers.  These weapons are mounted on the 
  hip/upper leg shields in battloid mode and in the lower back of the cyclone
  in motorcycle mode.  It appears as four small tubes built directly into
  the armored plate.  The missiles can only fire in battloid mode.  On VR-122s

  the launchers are usually loaded with armor-piercing missiles for anti-mecha

  defense.
  <P><UL>
  <LI><B>Primary Purpose</B>: Assault
  <LI><B>Secondary Purpose</B>: Anti-mecha
  <LI><B>Missile Type</B>: Any type of REF Mini-missile EXCEPT Plasma.
      Armor-piercing are standard-issue for the VR-122 Protector.
  <LI><B>Mega-Damage</B>: Varies with missile type.
  <LI><B>Rate of Fire</B>: One or two at a time.
  <LI><B>Range</B>: Varies with missile type; 20 ft to 1 mile.
  <LI><B>Payload</B>: 4 missiles per each launcher, for a total capacity of 8.
  </UL><P>
<LI><B>MODULAR WEAPON SYSTEMS</B>.  As with all REF Cyclones, the arm shields
  of the VR-122 Protector are designed to interface with one of the GR-series
  weapon modules.  One weapon module can be mounted on each forearm shield, 
  and it is not necessary to mount the same modules on each shield.  The 
  Cyclone's onboard computer system will automatically recognize which weapon
  module is installed and adjust the HUD displays on the pilot's helmet 
  accordingly.  Any GR-series weapon module can be used.
  <P>
  Typical VR-122s are assigned two <A HREF="./cycloneweapons.html#gr220">
  GR-220 BEAM CANNON/SMG</A> units, which were designed with the Protector in 
  mind.  Different weapons may be substituted if approved by a commanding 
  officer, however.  Click <A HREF="./cycloneweapons.html">HERE</A> for a 
  complete listing of cyclone weapon modules.
  <P>
<LI><B>Hand-to-Hand Combat</B>.  Punch does 1D4 M.D.  Kick does 1D6 M.D. (The 
  VR-122 Protector has an equivalent strength of PS 50)  Leap Kick 
  does 2D4 M.D.  Body Flip or Body Block does 1D4 M.D.
  <P>
<LI>Any type of hand-held weapon can be fired by the pilot while in 
  cyclone armor, including the new <A HREF="./ref-weapons.html#g1000">Gallant 
  1000 Multi-Weapon System</A>.  A Gallant 1000 AND a Putnam Stun-Gun are 
  standard issue for VR-122 pilots.
