<H1>THE INVID WARLORD BATTLOID</H1>
<H2>BACKGROUND</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=244 HEIGHT=353 BORDER=2 HSPACE=3
 SRC="./Images/warlordbattloid.gif">
On January 4th, 2044, several resistance bases in the northwest quadrant
of North America received a chilling radio transmission from the Viper-3
Silo Base in Cheyenne, Wyoming.  The message, though heavily broken up
by static, indicated that a powerful new threat now faced freedom
fighters.
<P>
<I>
"This is Jack Halloran, commanding officer... Viper-3 Resistance Base.  Have 
been attacked... by a large force of Invid.  20 Linebackers 
</I>(<A HREF="./combattrooper.html">Combat Troopers</A>)<I>... 5 or 6 Commandoes 
</I>(<A HREF="./strikeunit.html">Strike Units</A>)<I>... and... and... some 
sort of new battloid.  Looks like a demon from hell, complete with wings and
fire.  Bastard took out... all 6 of our Alphas by itself.  Far more
powerful than... anything we've encountered so far.  Almost everyone...
is dead.  I've ordered anyone still... alive... to make a run for it.
The Viper's Nest is gone.  Will try to transmit... all data on the demon
before I buy it.  Give 'em hell..."
</I>
<P>
Several groups of resistance fighters tried to assist Viper-3, but
they arrived far too late to be of any help.  The base was totally
destroyed, and no survivors were ever found.  What little data Commander
Halloran was able to transmit before the signal stopped completely was
garbled and of little aid to REF analysts.  What was perhaps most
terrifying of all was the condition in which the fallen REF mecha were
found.  Many had been literally dismembered and torn apart; their pilots
crushed to death inside their own cockpits.   Although the Invid were
never known for their gentleness, the amount of carnage indicated an
opponent who enjoyed making his enemies suffer.
<P>
Over the next month, a dozen other bases around the world reported
encountering a new type of Invid Battloid.  However, all 12 bases were
totally destroyed before they could transmit any useful data.  Then, in
mid-February of that year, resistance Wilderness Scouts discovered a
survivor from one of the attacks.  Corporal Steve White, an REF
Intelligence Agent, had managed to escape detection by abandoning his
Cyclone and hiding in a forest while his base was destroyed.  More
importantly, he had captured the new Invid battloid on film while it
sadistically killed his teammates.  Corporal White survived alone in the
forest for seven days before he was eventually found.  All the
information the REF has on what was then named the Invid Warlord
Battloid is due mostly to Corporal White's heroic efforts.  Corporal
White died of battle wounds 24 hours after being discovered.
<P>
The Invid Warlord Battloid is by far the deadliest mecha currently
fielded by the Invid.  Although the new mecha is obviously descended
from the old Royal Command Battloid, and perhaps from the new 
<A HREF="assaultbattloid.html">Assault Battloid</A> as well, this new 
mecha represents a quantum increase in firepower for Invid mecha.  In 
addition, the Warlord Battloid seems to include brand-new Invid technologies 
never before encountered, including remote drones and portable force-field 
barriers.
<P>
The Warlord Battloid is human shaped and stands upright, similar to the
old RCB.  The head of the mecha is larger, and has a number of fins
sprouting out of the top, making the mecha look like it's wearing a
headdress.  These  fins are swept back, giving the mecha an almost hawk-
like appearance. Two large fins are connected to the sides of the back
pack, almost  resembling wings.  The function of these wings are
unknown, but may have something to do with the remote-control drones.
<P>
The main body of the mecha has been redesigned.  The cockpit of the
mecha is higher and provides the pilot with more protection.  The legs
are similar to those on the RCB and Assault Battloid, but are broader
and have a different foot design.  The arms of the mecha have plasma
cannons built directly into them, similar to the Assault Battloid.
Instead of arm shields, however, the Warlord Battloid can generate a
force field similar to the force field of an Invid hive.  This force
field resembles a disk from the old pinpoint barrier system on the SDF-
1, and acts as a hand-held shield for the Warlord Battloid.  Both arms
of the mecha can generate shields simultaneously.  The energy shield
does not seem to be movable; the Warlord Battloid must move its arm in
order to reposition it.
<P>
The other new weapon that is unique to the Warlord is a set of 6 small
remote-control drones.  These drones are little more than plasma cannons
connected to a maneuvering engine, but are very fast and fairly
powerful. The Warlord Battloid can use these drones to swarm enemy mecha
and attack from all sides at once.  When not in use, the drones are
housed in the back of the mecha, between the two backpack nacelles.
<P>
In addition to the force fields and drones, the Warlord Battloid has a
number of other weapons systems.  There is of course a plasma cannon
located in each arm, but there are also two small plasma cannons located
in the head of the mecha, on either side of the sensor eye.  The missile
bays have been moved from the backpack to the shoulders and legs of the
mecha.  Presumably the backpack now contains the massive engines needed
to power all of the Warlord's weaponry.  Each shoulder launcher contains
15 missiles, and the pop-up launchers on each side of the leg (similar
to those on the Invid Strike Unit) contain ten missiles per leg.
<P>
Warlord Battloids are rarely encountered alone; they are usually
accompanied by an "honor guard" of Assault Battloids or Strike Units.
They are always the highest-ranking units on the battlefield.
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>NOTE</B>: Warlord Battloids are incredibly rare; there may be as few as two
dozen on the entire planet throughout the Third Invid War.  Gamemasters
should save these mecha for extremely important battles, such as the
climactic final battle of a multi-session adventure.  See the notes on
the new <A HREF="./stage6invid.html">Stage 6 Invid</A> for more details.

<B>Notes:</B>
<DL>
<DT>*
<DD> Destroying the Forearm will knock out the Plasma Cannon and Energy
     Shield.  The Plasma Cannons and Energy Shields CANNOT be targeted
     separately; the forearms must be destroyed to get rid of these
     systems.
<DT>**
<DD> This head sensor is not like the eye sensor.  Its destruction will
     knockout all sensor systems, leaving the pilot to rely only on
     visuals.  The head plasma cannons will also be destroyed.  The
     head's destruction will not destroy the mecha nor hurt the pilot.
<DT>***
<DD> Depleting the M.D.C. of the main body will shut the mecha down
     completely.
<DT>&amp;
<DD> The Energy Shields can regenerate at a rate of 50 MDC (each) per
     round.  See the entry under 'Weaponry' below for a full list of
     stats.

<H3>WEAPON SYSTEMS</H3>
<OL>
<LI><B>HEAD PLASMA CANNONS</B>.  Two small Invid beam cannons are mounted in the
   head of the mecha, just to either side of the sensor eye.  The
   weapons are fixed forward, and must be aimed by moving the head.  The
   head of the Warlord Battloid can rotate 40 degrees from side to side
   and 60 degrees up or down.<P>
   <UL>
   <LI><B>Primary Purpose</B>: Close Range Assault/Defense
   <LI><B>Range</B>: 4000 ft (1200 m)
   <LI><B>Damage</B>: One single blast (rare) does 2D6 M.D., dual blasts
     (simultaneous shots, same target) do 4D6 M.D. and a burst (6
     blasts, all at same target) does 6D6 M.D.
   <LI><B>Rate of Fire</B>: Six attacks per melee.  Dual blasts and bursts both
     count as ONE attack.
   <LI><B>Payload</B>: Unlimited
   <LI><B>Bonuses to Strike</B>: +2 to strike, plus protoculture targeting bonuses.
   </UL><P>
<LI><B>IMPROVED PLASMA CANNONS</B>.  The shielded plasma cannon of the older RCB
   design has been replaced with two newer plasma cannons, one mounted
   on each arm.  These cannons CANNOT be ejected like the older designs.
   The only way to remove/destroy the cannons is to destroy the forearms
   of the Warlord Battloid.<P>
   <UL>
   <LI><B>Primary Purpose</B>: Assault
   <LI><B>Range</B>: 4000 ft (1200 m)
   <LI><B>Damage</B>: Single shot does 4D6 M.D., and dual single shots do 1D6x10
     M.D.  A single burst does 1D6x10 M.D., and dual bursts do 2D6x10
     M.D. (Single shots, dual shots, single bursts, and dual bursts all
     count as one attack)  A strafing, continuous full melee burst
     (shooting wild), does 2D6 M.D. for each item or area hit if one
     arm cannon is used, or 4D6 M.D. if both arm cannons are used.
     Shooting wild counts as ALL attacks, regardless if one or both
     arms are used.
   <LI><B>Rate of Fire</B>: Equal to hand to hand attacks (6 single shots or 6
     bursts).
   <LI><B>Payload</B>: Unlimited.
   <LI><B>Bonuses to Strike</B>: +3 to strike, plus protoculture targeting bonuses.
   </UL><P>
<LI><B>SHOULDER MISSILE LAUNCHERS</B>.  Two missile launchers are built into the
   shoulders of the mecha.  These launchers are normally protected by an
   armored plate that pops open when firing.<P>
   <UL>
   <LI><B>Primary Purpose</B>: Assault
   <LI><B>Secondary Purpose</B>: Anti-Aircraft
   <LI><B>Range</B>: Short range, 2 to 5 miles (3.2 to 8 km)
   <LI><B>Damage</B>: Plasma missiles, doing 1D6x10 M.D. per hit.
   <LI><B>Rate of Fire</B>: One at a time, in volleys of 2-15 missiles.  All
     missiles from both launchers (30 total) can be fired as a single
     volley if necessary.  Remember, one volley counts as one attack
     regardless of the number of missiles.
   <LI><B>Payload</B>: 15 short range missiles in each shoulder for a total of 30.
   <LI><B>Bonuses to Strike</B>: +3 to strike, but no protoculture targeting
     bonuses.
   </UL><P>
<LI><B>LEG MISSILE LAUNCHERS</B>.  Two missile launchers are built into each leg
   of the mecha.  These launchers are normally concealed in the legs but
   pop open when ready to fire.  Each launcher holds 5 missiles for a
   total of 10 missiles per leg (20 total).<P>
   <UL>
   <LI><B>Primary Purpose</B>: Assault
   <LI><B>Secondary Purpose</B>: Anti-Aircraft
   <LI><B>Range</B>: Short range, 2 to 5 miles (3.2 to 8 km)
   <LI><B>Damage</B>: Plasma missiles, doing 1D6x10 M.D. per hit.
   <LI><B>Rate of Fire</B>: One at a time, in volleys of 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10
     missiles.  All missiles from both legs (20 total) can be fired as
     a single volley if necessary.  Remember, one volley counts as one
     attack regardless of the number of missiles.
   <LI><B>Payload</B>: 5 short range missiles in each launcher.  10 missiles per
     leg, 20 total.
   <LI><B>Bonuses to Strike</B>: +3 to strike, but no protoculture targeting
     bonuses.
   </UL><P>
<LI><B>ENERGY SHIELDS</B>.  The Warlord Battloid can generate a portable energy
   shield from each arm.  This circular force field resembles the old
   pinpoint barrier system on the SDF-1, and is primarily used to block
   incoming fire from enemy units.  Each arm can generate an individual
   shield of 100 MDC, or the two generators can work together to create
   a more powerful shield that has 200 MDC.  An energy shield
   regenerates at 50 MDC per melee round.  If the shield receives more
   damage than its MDC value, the additional damage is transferred to
   the mecha normally.<P>

   <B>EXAMPLE</B> : A Warlord Battloid intercepts a volley of 3 missiles with
   its energy shield.  The missiles do 30, 30, and 50 MD in damage,
   respectively, for a total of 110 MD to the shield.  10 MD get through
   and damage the main body of the mecha.  Any other attacks that strike
   the Battloid in THE SAME MELEE ROUND will do full damage to the
   mecha.  The Warlord Battloid's energy shield will have 50 MDC
   starting next melee round.<P>

   A hit from a Destabilizer cannon will totally eliminate the energy
   shield's MDC, regardless of how much damage it does.  However, the
   shield will regenerate normally at a rate of 50 MDC/melee after that.<P>
   <UL>
   <LI><B>Primary Purpose</B>: Defense
   <LI><B>Mega-Damage Capacity</B>: 100 MDC for one arm, or 200 MDC for both arms.
   <LI><B>Note</B>: Can regenerate at a rate of 50 MDC per melee round (15
     seconds).
   </UL><P>
<LI><B>ATTACK DRONES</B>.  The Warlord Battloid carries a complement of 6 attack
   drones in its backpack.  When engaged in combat, the Battloid will
   launch these drones, which will then dart around the mecha in a
   seemingly random pattern.  Each Attack Drone is armed with a high-powered
   plasma cannon.  The Stage 6 Invid pilot can control these
   drones telepathically, and direct them to attack one or multiple
   targets.  The Attack Drones will always stay near the Warlord
   Battloid, and if the Battloid is destroyed then the Drones will also
   self-destruct.  NOTE: If the Warlord Battloid is heavily damaged, the
   drones will usually collide with an opponent to give the Battloid
   time to escape.<P>
   <UL>
   <LI><B>Primary Purpose</B>: Assault
   <LI><B>Secondary Purpose</B>: Defense
   <LI><B>Range</B>: 6000 feet (1800 m) max
   <LI><B>Mega Damage</B>: 1D6x10 per blast.  Bursts are not possible.  Collision
     Damage: 6D6 MDC per hit.
   <LI><B>Rate of Fire</B>: Each Drone can fire up to 3 times per melee round.
   <P>
   The stage 6 Invid can combine the attacks of the drones with his or
   her own attacks.  In this case, the simultaneous attacks from one or
   more drones count as part of the pilot's melee actions/attacks and
   fire at the very instant that he or she fires.
   <P>
   <B>For example</B>: A Warlord Battloid is accompanied by three drones, who
   all fire at the exact same moment and at the exact same target the
   Battloid is shooting at.  If the Battloid was using blasts from both
   Plasma Cannons, then the combined damage from the volley would be
   5D6x10 MD (50-300 MD) from that single attack!!
   <P>
   If the stage 6 Invid is not controlling the drones, then they will
   randomly circle the Warlord Battloid and attack the nearest target
   that is in range.  Roll initiative and to-hit rolls separately for
   each drone.
   <P>
   <LI><B>Bonus to Strike</B>: +3 to hit, NO protoculture bonuses (except in
     simultaneous attacks with the Warlord Battloid).
   <LI><B>Payload</B>: Unlimited.
   <LI><B>Size</B>: 5 feet (1.8 m) long.
   <LI><B>Weight</B>: 2 tons.
   <LI><B>Speed</B>: Equal to the Warlord Battloid; about Mach 3 (2010 mph).
   <LI><B>Main Body of the Drone</B>: 50 MDC.  Attackers are at -4 to strike
     because the drones are so small.
   </UL><P>
<LI><B>INITIATIVE BONUS</B>.  Due to the telepathic/empathic powers of the Stage
   6 Invid, the pilot can often sense an attacker's presence as he
   approaches.  Because of this, Warlord Battloids get a special bonus
   when rolling initiative.  It is IMPOSSIBLE to surprise a Warlord
   Battloid, and the Battloid gets a bonus of +3 to all initiative
   rolls.<P>

   <B>SPECIAL CASE</B>:  If the Warlord Battloid is attacked by a Shadow
   Fighter, then during the first round of combat the Warlord Battloid
   and the Shadow Fighter both roll a contest with a D20.  Whoever has
   the higher number gets the first attack, and the loser goes the
   second attack.  The rest of the combatants roll initiative normally.<P>

   For a complete listing of telepathic/empathic powers exclusive to the
   stage 6 Invid, see the <A HREF="./stage6invid.html">stage 6 Invid</A> 
   stats.<P>

<LI><B>HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT</B>.
   <UL>
   <LI><B>Attacks Per Melee</B>: Six
   <LI><B>Hand to Hand Bonuses</B>: +5 to strike, +6 to parry, +3 to dodge on the
     ground, +5 automatic dodge when flying at any speed (an automatic
     dodge works like a parry and does not forfeit an attack), +5 to
     roll with a punch, fall, or impact, +3 on initiative (plus special
     bonuses; see above).
   <LI><B>Types of Attacks</B>: Punch: 3D6 M.D.  Crush with Hand: 2D4 M.D. per
     melee round.  Kick: 2D6 M.D.  Leap Kick: 3D6 M.D.  Body Flip: 2D4
     M.D.  Body Block/Ram: 3D6 M.D., counts as two attacks.  Stomp: 2D6
     M.D., target must be 15 ft (4.5 m) or smaller.
