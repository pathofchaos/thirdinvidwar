<H1>THE INVID SPACE HIVE</H1>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=247 HEIGHT=350 BORDER=2 HSPACE=3 
 SRC="./Images/spacehive.gif">
<H2>BACKGROUND</H2>
The tide of Third Invid War seemed to turn against the resistance in early
2040 when reports started coming in of dozens of new lights appearing in the
night sky.  Further investigation revealed that these "lights" were some sort
of space stations being constructed by the Invid all around the Earth.  What
was even more disturbing was that initial reports showed that over half of the
Invid occupation force was involved in the construction of the space stations.
 (This would also explain why the size of the Invid occupation force was so
small during the first few years of the Third Invid War)  This massive Invid
construction effort would continue for two more years before their project was
complete.
<P>
It would later be revealed that the Invid were constructing a series of
Orbiting Hives, specifically constructed for anti-starship operations.  The
Stage Six Invid in charge had analyzed the results of the Second Invid War,
and concluded that the humans' victory was for the most part due to the
supplies and personnel they managed to get from the REF at Tirol.  The Stage
Six Invid decided that the best way to prevent a repeat of history was to
prevent any REF ships or troops from reaching Earth.  To this end, they
constructed a series of "Space Hives" armed with powerful anti-starship
weaponry and defended by a modified hive shield.  These orbiting hives would
also be able to serve as bases for the Invid space forces, which made up
roughly 40% of the Invid occupation forces.
<P>
Invid Space Hives look somewhat similar to stilt hives, except that instead of
stilts, the central hive has 6 large spikes sticking out of them, equally
spaced along all of the sphere's axes.  These spikes contain the massive
anti-starship cannons that make up the main armament for the hive, as well as
the shield generators that protect it.  The cannons have no nozzle or any
other feature that give them away, except for the fact that they're colored
differently than the rest of the hive.  The central globe of the hive consists
mostly of docking bays, where the various space Invid can land to refuel and
rearm.  The major docking bays on the station are big enough to hold multiple
Troop Transports or Cargo Transports.  All docking bays are protected by force
fields that keep atmosphere in while allowing ships and mecha to pass through
them freely.  These force fields can be strengthened in intensity to keep
invaders out of the hive (though they are still vulnerable to Destabilizer
cannons).  At the center of the central hive is the massive power core that
powers the entire station.  The power cores of Space Hives are 30% larger than
those typically found in Earth hives.  This is due to the tremendous amount of
power that the anti-starship cannons and the defense shield require.
<P>
At the height of the Third Invid War there were 92 Space Hives orbiting the
Earth.  24 of these hives were <B>Sector Command Space Hives</B>, which served
as command and control bases for the <A HREF="./stage6invid.html">Stage 6
Invid</A> during the war.  The sector command hives were 25% larger than
standard hives and contained significantly more troops.  Below is a rough map
of the locations of the orbiting hives during the war.  However, it is
important to note that while the hives spent most of their time in
geosynchronous orbit over their assigned location, they can and often did
alter their orbit to circle over trouble spots when necessary.

<LI> Depleting the MDC of a weapon spike will effectively destroy it.
     This will also completely destroy the anti-starship cannon inside
     (the other 5 will still function, though).  However, the best news
     of all is that destruction of even ONE weapon spike will completely
     destroy the force field generator!  NOTE: the force field must be
     down/damaged before the weapon spike may be attacked.
<LI> Depleting the MDC of the central power core will cause an explosion
     that effectively destroy the station.  The Invid Brain will
     automatically be killed, in addition to (1D10x10)% of all Invid
     still remaining on the station.  The burning hulk of the space hive
     will fall out of orbit and burn up in the atmosphere within 1D6
     days.
<LI> Depleting the MDC of the main hive will effectively destroy the
     station.  100% of all Invid left on the station are killed.  The
     burning hulk of the space hive will fall out of orbit and burn up
     in the atmosphere within 1D6 days.

<H3>SPECIFICATIONS</H3>

<DT><B>Flight:</B>
<DD>The Antigravity Domes are mainly for station-keeping
  purposes only.  If necessary, the space hive can adjust its orbit,
  or even travel to the moon's orbit or beyond.  It will take a
  space hive 24 hours to transfer from Earth orbit to Moon orbit.
  Space Hives do NOT have fold generators!

<H3>WEAPON SYSTEMS</H3>
<OL>
<LI>ANTI-STARSHIP CANNONS.  The main armament of the Space Hive are six
   massive anti-starship cannons that are even more powerful than the
   main gun of an Ikazuchi starship!  The cannons are spaced equidistant
   around the hive so as to leave no arc undefended.  In fact, most
   times 3-5 cannons can be brought to bear on a single target.  Each
   cannon has an effectively unlimited arc of fire (except when blocked
   by the station itself). <P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Primary Purpose</B>: Anti-spacecraft/assault
<LI><B>Range</B>: 300,000 miles (480,000 km)
<LI><B>Mega-Damage</B>: 1D6x1000 M.D.
<LI><B>Rate of Fire</B>: Each cannon may fire ONCE every other melee.
<LI><B>Payload</B>: Effectively Unlimited.
<LI><B>Note</B>: These cannons are meant for use against spacecraft only.  All
     bonuses/penalties for target size apply.  See the table on page 53
     of the Sentinels RPG.
</UL>
<P>
<LI>FORCE FIELD.  The weapon spikes on the hive can also generate a force
   field to protect the hive from harm.  When this field is activated,
   the shield extends from each spike to all the other spikes
   surrounding it, effectively making the station look like it is
   encased in a diamond.  NOTE: The Anti-Starship Cannons CAN still fire
   when the force field is up.  HOWEVER, no mecha or ships may be
   launched from the hive when the shield is up.  A Destabilizer cannon
   will penetrate this shield just like a normal hive shield.<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Primary Purpose</B>: Defense
<LI><B>Mega-Damage Capacity</B>: 1,000,000 MDC
