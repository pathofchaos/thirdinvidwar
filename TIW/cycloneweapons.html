<H1>CYCLONE WEAPON MODULES</H1>
One of the key features of the cyclone design is the modular weapon systems
it can use.  The arm shields of all cyclone models can be customized with a 
variety of different weapon packages, allowing the mecha to be equipped with
an array of weapons that match the requirements of its mission.  The first
generation cyclones had only three different weapon modules, the <I>GR-97 
Plasma Missile Launcher</I>, the <I>EP-37 Beam Cannon</I>, and the <I>RL-6
Portable Rocket Launcher</I>.  The second generation cyclones were designed
so that they could use all of the above modules, PLUS a whole new series of
modular weapons being designed by REF engineers.  The below list represents
the weapon modules most commonly found on Earth during the Third Invid War.
Newer modules are constantly in development, however, helping to increase 
the versatility and efficitiveness of the Cyclone mecha.

<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="./Images/gr200.gif">
Designed especially for 
the VR-152 Battler II, this popular cyclone weapon unit is based on 
the old GR-97 Missile Launcher design used on the VR-052 Battler.  
The new unit mounts two one-shot plasma missile launchers, combined 
with a modified beam cannon derived from the older EP-37 design.  The 
plasma missiles give the cyclone a heavy punch, and the beam cannons 
provide an energy weapon to fall back on when the missiles are gone.  
The GR-200 is the commonly requested and issued unit for cyclone 
units expecting heavy combat.
<P>
The beam cannon draws power directly from the cyclone's fusion reactor, 
giving the weapon unlimited ammo so long as the reactor is 
functioning.  The disadvantage to this is that there is no backup 
supply, and the beam cannon becomes useless hardware when the GR-200 
is detached (though some resistance fighters have been known to "hot-
wire" the weapon into another power supply).  The missile launchers 
are of course one-shot weapons.

<B>GR-215 BEAM CANNONS</B></A><P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="./Images/gr215.gif">
The GR-215 is an energy-only weapon package for 
cyclones.  Two different weapons are mounted on the unit; a beam 
cannon, for a high damage at short range, and a small particle 
cannon, which packs less punch but has a much greater range and 
accuracy.  The particle cannon uses a guiding laser for maintaining 
beam coherence, which in a pinch can be used at lower power settings 
for utilitarian purposes such as wielding and cutting.
<P>
The GR-215 was originally designed for use with the VR-135 Forager 
survival cyclone.  The cyclone designers felt that reliance on 
missiles would be too big a hinderance in a guerilla combat situation 
such as the Invid Wars, and so designed the GR-215 to provide a 
dynamic range of energy-weapons that did not require ammo.  In 
addition, the 215 is the only weapon package designed to take power 
directly from an external energy clip, in case the cyclone's reactor 
is malfunctioning or otherwise unable to supply power.  Finally, as a 
direct result of the survival philosophy behind the Forager, the GR-
215s were designed to be extremely simple to maintain and repair int 
the field <I>(+20% to repair and modification rolls)</I>.  Instructions for 
disassembling and reassembling the GR-215 are actually printed on the 
weapon itself.
<P>
VR-135 Forager cyclones come automatically equipped with a pair of GR-
215s, but the popularity of the unit has led it to be commonly used 
on other cyclone designs as well.  It is often used in conjunction 
with another weapon system, such as the GR-200 or a CADS system, in 
order to provide greater variety in weapon selection.

The GR-215 draws power directly from the on-board fusion 
    reactor, so it is effectively unlimited as long as it remains 
    attached to the cyclone.  The weapon has an emergency E-clip port 
    that will give it 40 particle beam shots or 20 beam cannon blasts per 
    clip if necessary.

<B>GR-220 BEAM CANNON/4.45mm SMG</B></A><P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="./Images/gr220.gif">
The GR-220 was designed in response to the need 
for a weapon unit that combined the high destructive power of a beam 
cannon with a more discreet conventional weapon.  Such a mix is 
useful in both guard and law enforcement duty, where the conventional 
weaponry can be used as a deterrent, and the beam weapon used against 
heavier opponents.  The GR-220 uses a light beam cannon combined with 
a 4.45 mm submachine gun, all concealed by a cover plate so as to not 
overly indicate the power of the unit.  The 220 is commonly issued to 
VR-122 Protector cyclones or VR-120 Ferrets on guard duty.

The beam cannon draws power directly from the on-board fusion 
reactor, so it is effectively unlimited as long as it remains 
attached to the cyclone.  The cannon is useless if detached.  The SMG 
has 60 rounds per clip, and extra clips are usually stored in the 
carrying bags of the Cyclone.

<IMG SRC="./Images/cads2.gif">
<BR CLEAR=LEFT>
Also called "CADS-
Super," this advanced version of the original CADS system is standard 
issue for the VR-141 Super Saber. Instead of sword blades, the disk-
shaped hub units conceal whirling buzz-saw blades that can cut 
through solid steel girders in seconds.  This attachment has great 
possibilities in the field of sabotage and demolitions as well as 
that of espionage.  Like its predecessor, it is mostly silent, except 
for a low hum and the sound of the blades whirring.  Unfortunately 
when cutting through metal, the CADS-2 will tend to make a great deal 
of noise, spoiling any chance of surprise.
<P>
Like its predecessor, the CADS-2 also contains an energy shield that can 
be used to shield the mecha from harm if necessary.  The CADS-2 is 
large and awkward, and cannot be used as a weapon if detached from 
the Cyclone mecha.  The unit draws power directly from the cyclone's 
onboard fusion reactor.

<B>GR-117 RESCUE HOOK</B></A><P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="./Images/gr117.gif">
The GR-117 is a rather unique weapon system originally designed for the VR-117 Firefly rescue cyclone.  The primary "weapon" of the GR-117 is a grappling hook launcher with an extremely strong cable and hook.  The grappling hook can be used in a variety of purposes, such as a makeshift crane, cable for pulling, or even for securing loose and crumbling fixtures.  It can be used for it's original purpose of scaling buildings and walls as well, of course.  In addition to the grappling hook, a welding laser is mounted on the module to allow the user to cut through bulkheads and rubble.  The GR-117 unit is NOT designed with combat purposes in mind.
