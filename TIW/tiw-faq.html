Greetings, and welcome to the <A HREF="../thirdinvidwar.html"><B>Third Invid 
War</B></A>!  Thanks to everyone who's been sending us comments and
compliments on our work; we really value your feedback.  However, I've noticed
several questions that come up again and again, so I thought I'd take some
time to make up a list of answers to the most frequently asked questions
(FAQs) about TIW.  These questions and answers are listed below...
<P>
<OL>
<LI><A HREF="#q1"><B>How does TIW relate to the book 'End of the Circle'?  Weren't Lancer

<OL>
<LI><A NAME="q1"><B><I>How does TIW relate to the book</I></A> 
<A HREF="http://www.randomhouse.com/delrey/robotech.shtml">'End of the Circle'</A> <I>by 
Jack McKinney?  Weren't Lancer and Sera killed after the Invid left?  How about the comic 
series</I> 'Invid War Aftermath'?</B>
<P>
TIW doesn't relate in any way to the Jack McKinney Robotech novels or any of
the Robotech comic series published by Academy Comics.  First and foremost TIW
is a sequel to the Robotech Role Playing Game, and is primarily based on that
continuity of the Robotech universe.  Therefore events in the novels or comics
(such as the deaths of Lancer and Sera, or the entire Belmont saga from the
comics) have no relation to events in TIW or sequels to TIW.
<P>
<LI><A NAME="q2"><B><I>Doesn't having the Invid return to Earth after the TV series ends
sorta contradict the show?  Have you read Peter Walker's essay on the
subject?</I></B></A>
<P>
Yes, I have read Peter's essay on the unlikelihood of the Invid returning,
and while I agree with most of it in a sense the damage has already been done.
Like I said above, TIW is a <B>sequel</B> to the Robotech RPG, therefore I try to
stay fairly consistent with events described in the RPG, including the
questionable second invasion by the Invid of Earth.  In fact, the primary
purpose of TIW is to try and continue what Palladium started, for better or worse.
<P>
Some people insist that any sequel to Robotech must be 100% consistent with
the TV show above all else, or it really isn't a sequel to Robotech at all. 
Personally I think these people need to chill out a little. ^_^  I freely
admit that TIW is not and never will be completely consistent with the
Robotech TV series.  However, I'm not going to loose much sleep over that.  I
hope that people will judge TIW based on how creative and entertaining it is,
and not on trivialities and canonical nit-picking.
<P>
<LI><A NAME="q3"><B><I>Could you post the complete rules to the Robotech RPG 
to your web site?</I></B></A>
<P>
Sorry, but the Robotech RPG is property of 
<A HREF="http://www.palladiumbooks.com"><B>Palladium Books</B></A> and is
protected by international copyright law, which makes it a crime to publicly
post material from the actual RPG books.  You can probably get copies of the
books from your local RPG store (look in the phone book under "hobbies") or
you can write Palladium books directly for a catalog at:
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>PALLADIUM BOOKS</B><BR>
2455 Universal Drive<BR>
Taylor, Mi 48180
</BLOCKQUOTE><P>
International fans can try to order the books overseas from:
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>MAIL ORDER HOBBY SHOP</B><BR>
P.O. Box 756<BR>
Lake Geneva, WI 53147<BR>
USA
</BLOCKQUOTE><P>
You can also order the books online from the Palladium Books website at 
<A HREF="http://www.palladiumbooks.com"><B>http://www.palladiumbooks.com</B></A>.
<P>
The only real book you need to play TIW is <B>Robotech II: The Sentinels</B>
($14.95, ISBN 0-916211-33-9), though <B>Invid Invasion</B> ($11.95, ISBN
0-916211-28-2) and the <B>REF Field Guide</B> ($14.95, ISBN 0-916211-36-3)
would be helpful as supplements.  Unfortunately two other RPG books referenced
by TIW, <B>Return of the Masters</B> ($9.95, ISBN 0-916211-29-8) and
<B>Lancer's Rockers</B> ($7.95, 0-916211-42-8), are no longer published by
Palladium Books and are very difficult to locate.
<P>
<LI><A NAME="q4"><B><I>Are you officially related to Palladium Books in any way?</I></B></A>
<P>
Other than the fact that I buy their products, no. ^_^ TIW is an entirely
not-for-profit by-fans-for-fans production.
<P>
If you really want to get in touch with Palladium, there is a comment submission
form on Palladium's web page at 
<A HREF="http://www.palladiumbooks.com/Q%26A.HTM"><B>http://www.palladiumbooks.com/Q&amp;A.HTM</B></A>.  
You might also want to get on the Palladium internet mailing list, where 
reportedly some official Palladium representatives hang out from time to time.  
To subscribe to the mailing list, send email to
<B>palladium-request@soda.csua.berkeley.edu</B> with the word "subscribe" (no
quotes) as your subject.
<P>
<LI><A NAME="q5"><B><I>Do you ever plan to publish TIW as an official RPG
supplement?</I></B></A>
<P>
Probably not.  I'd prefer to keep TIW as a web-based RPG resource free for
anyone who is interested in it for the time being.  Also, I believe Palladium
Books has a standing policy to not pursue manuscripts that have been 
previously published on the web.
<P>
<LI><A NAME="q6"><B><I>The Robotech RPG has a lot of flaws in it.  Many of the mecha
designs don't accurately represent the show, the MDC system sucks, weapon
damages are totally out of scale, etc., etc.  Why don't you try and correct
some of these flaws?</I></B></A>
<P>
Correcting the Robotech RPG is not the point of TIW.  It makes more sense NOT
to try and improve on the gaming mechanics, because TIW is so dependent on
earlier supplements and adventures produced by Palladium.  Any changes I made
to the rules for my supplement would in turn require dramatic changes to the
already published stuff to make sure everything works together.  It makes more
sense to make my stuff 100% compatible with what's already been published,
including all flaws therein.
<P>
Here's why: making TIW fully compatible with the RPG also helps
Palladium-haters who have adapted Robotech to other systems.  How?  Well,
anyone who really hates the Robotech RPG but still plays it probably already
has a whole list of house rules to modify the system into something they like
better.  Any house rules you are already using should work just fine with TIW
mecha since they're Palladium-compatible, so you can continue to use your own
rules systems without having to work out new ways to translate mecha to your
tastes.
<P>
<LI><A NAME="q7"><B><I>Why don't you use a better mecha gaming system like Mekton
Zeta?</I></B></A>
<P>
Since TIW is so closely linked to events in the Robotech TV series, it doesn't
make sense to move to a different RPG system at this time.  All the older
mecha, characters, and locations that may pop up in a TIW adventure have
already been covered by Palladium; why repeat that work?  If I started using
Mekton Zeta or a similar system for TIW I'd have to translate everything from
Robotech into the new system, and even I'm not that ambitious right this
moment. ^_^
<P>
<LI><A NAME="q8"><B><I>Aren't these mecha a little overpowered?</I></B></A>
<P>
That's part of the story.  The technological power and superior numbers of the 
Invid give them a definite edge during the early years of the war.  This gives
players a better perspective of desperation and helplessness when they realize
that they are no longer hot stuff just because they own some Shadow Alphas and
Vindicators.  They will have to learn to be tactically smarter and more
cautious early on in order to survive.  As the war continues, the arrival of
more advanced mecha from the REF helps to close the power gap, but the days of
players knocking out entire hives via brute force with one Alpha and some
cyclones are pretty much over.
<P>
<LI><A NAME="q9"><B><I>Do you plan to create any Destroids for TIW?  Or Hovertanks?</I></B></A>
<P>
Originally, no.  Most destroids, even the smaller scale ones, don't seem to
fit into the geurilla combat scenarios of the Third Invid War very well. 
Without the speed and flight capabilities of Veritechs, or the small size and
agility of Cyclones, Destroids are at a disadvantage most of the time against
the Invid, since without the speed or ability to hide they can be cut to
pieces by flying patrols of Invid mecha.  Plus there's the problem of getting
the Destroids to Earth in the first place, since most transports that
attempted to get to the surface were atomized by the Invid Space Hives.  Due
to all the reasons above, I originally decided to not worry too much about
Destroids for TIW.
<P>
However, due to overwhelming demand I have decided to include a few Destroid
designs in the supplement.  They are currently in the planning stages and
won't be available for a while yet.  There is also a tenative Hovertank Mk. II
design in the works for you Hovertank fanatics out there.
<P>
<LI><A NAME="q10"><B><I>How about a Shadow Cyclone?</I></B></A>
<P>
Urk.  Cyclones equipped with shadow cloaking devices seem a little
overpowered, even to me.  Most cyclones already have a cloaking system of
sorts in the fact that they can use alternate sources of power instead of
Protoculture when necessary.  Plus there's the fact that the RPG makes enough
concessions to Cyclone pilots already (heavy armaments and heavier armor) and
the mecha doesn't need any more power-boosting.  The shadow cyclone published 
in Protoculture Addicts years ago seems especially unbalancing to game
play.  For these reasons we have decided that Shadow Cyclones will never be an
official part of TIW or Guardians.  The shadow cloaking device can simply not
be produced in a small enough size to be used in anything smaller than a
medium fighter.
<P>
<LI><A NAME="q11"><B><I>You mention something called "Robotech: Guardians" several times in
the web pages.  What the heck is "Guardians", anyway?</I></B></A>
<P>
Basically, <B>Guardians</B> is the sequel to TIW.  It will consist of three
separate RPG supplements and will focus mainly on the Sentinels worlds after
the Robotech wars have ended.  Beyond that I really don't want to say much
about <B>Guardians</B> right now; most of the stuff in it is still in the
planning stages and I don't want to say something and then have to change it
later.  Please be patient.
<P>
<LI><A NAME="q12"><B><I>Why the heck is TIW taking so long??  You should have had this
supplement done long ago!</I></B></A>
<P>
TIW is a hobby, not a job.  I'm not getting paid for this, so therefore other
more important matters have to come first.  I won't bore you with sob stories
about how hard work is.  Basically it comes down to the fact that after
working 9-10 hours per day I usually don't feel very creative when I get home.
I'm really sorry about the delays and lack of progress sometimes, but that's
life.
<P>
<LI><A NAME="q13"><B><I>Can you make TIW available via anonymous FTP (file-transfer
protocol) instead of the web?</I></B></A>
<P>
I'm working on it...
<!-- Yep!  Most of the text and graphics of TIW (and the Macross Mecha Designs as
well) are available via anonymous FTP from ÇA
HREF="ftp://ftp.io.com/pub/usr/deitrich/"ÈÇBÈftp.io.comÇ/BÈÇ/AÈ in the
directory ÇA HREF="ftp://ftp.io.com/pub/usr/deitrich/"È/pub/usr/deitrichÇ/AÈ. 
For more information on how to download files, click ÇA
HREF="../Misc/download.shtml"ÈÇBÈHEREÇ/BÈÇ/AÈ. -->
<P>
<LI><A NAME="q14"><B><I>Is TIW available as one file so I don't have to download all these
HTML files?</I></B></A>
<P>
Yep!  At <A HREF="ftp://ftp.io.com/pub/usr/deitrich/">ftp.io.com</A> there is
a file called <A HREF="ftp://ftp.io.com/pub/usr/deitrich/thirdinvidwar.txt">
<B>thirdinvidwar.txt</B></A>.  This file contains all of TIW that is currently
available in the form of a single text file for easy downloading.  This file
will constantly be updated as more stuff is added to TIW, so you will always
be able to download the latest version of the supplement by downloading this
file.  Be warned, though; the file is over 100 pages long and growing rapidly.
^_^;
<P>
<LI><A NAME="q15"><B><I>I have some mecha designs here that I made up myself.  Would you be
interested in making them part of TIW or Guardians?</I></B></A>
<P>
Sure, I'm always interesting in seeing other people's designs and stuff!  If
you have some of your own mecha you've created for Robotech, by all means
please send me copies.  I'll even try to find space on my web pages to put
them up, so that everyone can enjoy your creativity.
<P>
<I>HOWEVER,</I> please don't think that just because I'd like to see your work
I have a moral obligation to include it as part of TIW.  If I don't include
your mecha in TIW it's probably not because I don't like it, but more likely
because it conflicts with something I have planned for TIW or Guardians. 
There is a story I'm trying to tell in TIW, and unfortunately some mecha
designs just don't fit in with my plans very well.
<P>
<LI><A NAME="q16"><B><I>Where can I find books, toys, etc. from Robotech?</I></B></A>
<P>
Other than the RPG books (look at 
<A HREF="http://www.palladiumbooks.com/">http://www.palladiumbooks.com/</A>) <B>I 
don't know</B>.  Just because I write stuff based on Robotech doesn't mean I'm the ultimate 
authority on all Robotech merchandise.  Try posting a request in the newsgroups 
<A HREF="news:alt.tv.robotech"><B>alt.tv.robotech</B></A> or 
<A HREF="news:alt.fan.robotech"><B>alt.fan.robotech</B></A>.  You may get lucky and 
find a lead on the item you're looking for.
<P>
<LI><A NAME="q17"><B><I>Is there any place I can see Robotech on TV or Video anymore?</I></B></A>
<P>
If you have cable and get the <A HREF="http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/"><B>Cartoon 
Network</B></A> then you're in luck!  As of Monday, January 12, 1998 Cartoon Network
has begun showing Robotech as part of their <B><I>Toonami</I></B> weekday lineup.  
In the U.S. the series airs Monday thru Friday at 4:45 PM eastern time (3:45 PM central).
I have no idea if Cartoon Network is showing Robotech on its international stations,
and if so at what times.
<P>
If you don't get Cartoon Network (or don't get cable) you can still get Robotech on
video.  Family Home Entertainment (FHE) is currently releasing Robotech on VHS video,
with 2 episodes per tape at $14.95 each.  You can probably find some of these tapes 
in your local video store (<B>Suncoast Video</B> is a good store to try) or you can
order them online from mail-order stores such as 
<A HREF="http://www.videoexpress.com/"><B>Video Express</B></A>.
