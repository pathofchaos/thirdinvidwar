<H1>THE INVID SENTINEL</H1>
<H2>BACKGROUND</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=242 HEIGHT=350 BORDER=2 HSPACE=3
 SRC="./Images/sentinel.gif">
The Invid Sentinel is unique among the new Invid mecha, because unlike
the other new mecha designs the Sentinel seems to have been created to
complement an existing mecha instead of replace it.  The Sentinel
appears to be designed specifically to work alongside the original Invid
Enforcer.  Appearing in late 2043, the Invid Sentinel seemed to take
over the job as "Hive Guard", freeing the more advanced Enforcers for
more delicate and detailed work.  Invid Sentinels soon became the
standard guard unit for all of the Invid's strongholds, working in
Hives, Slave Farms, Genesis Pits, etc.  Sentinels are commonly found
with Enforcers, with the latter usually in command of the former.
<P>
The Invid Sentinel is human-sized and human-shaped, much like the
Enforcer.  However, the Sentinel design appears much more combat-
oriented than the older Enforcer design.  The Sentinel is far bulkier
than its cousin, and seems to have much thicker armor than the Enforcer.
The increased armor has done nothing to slow the mecha down; in fact,
the Sentinel is actually faster than the old Enforcer!  This is due to a
much larger thruster on the back of the mecha, and the addition of
several concealed vernier jets at strategic locations on the outside of
the armor.  The Sentinel also has powerful legs that are slightly longer
than the Enforcer's, allowing it to run faster and jump farther than the
older mecha.
<P>
The head and sensor eye of the mecha is shaped like a snout, similar to
the Enforcer's head.  However, the snout is smaller and more concealed.
The arms of the mecha look almost identical to those of the Enforcer.
One new addition is a large cannon located on the right shoulder.  This
cannon appears to be a particle-beam cannon and is the main weapon of
the new mecha.  The cannon swings upward when not in use, and rotates
downward when about to be fired.  The cannon is mounted on a swiveling
turret, and can move 45 degrees downward, 90 degrees upward, and 45
degrees to either side.  It apparently cannot point behind the mecha.
<P>
The main weapon of the Sentinel is the new PBC on the shoulder, but it
also has the same weaponry as the Enforcer.  There is a concealed laser
in each forearm (identical to the Enforcer's) and the Sentinel can use
the same energy rifle and energy shield that the Enforcer does.  Another
new weapon is a pair of concealed mini-missile launchers on each arm.
Each mini-missile launcher holds one missile (for a total of 4) and pops
open when the Sentinel is about to fire.  These launchers are located on
the sides of the arms, while the concealed laser is located on the tops
of the arms.
<P>
Invid Sentinels are piloted by Stage Three Invid, and are thus NOT
capable of independent thought.  While they are capable of doing simple
tasks by themselves (such as patrolling the hive and guarding
prisoners), they require a Stage Four or higher Invid to command them in
complex tasks.  Their first instinct in a battle will be to protect
their commander.

<P>
<B>Notes:</B>
<DL>
<DT>* 
<DD> The sensor eye is the most vulnerable place on the Invid's mecha
    body.  Destruction of the sensor eye will kill/destroy the mecha and
    pilot (goes right through crew compartment).  However, it is a small
    target protected by surrounding shielding, thus, to hit it the
    player/character must make a called shot and is at -3 to strike.
<DT>**
<DD> Depleting the M.D.C. of the main body will shut the mecha down
    completely.  There is no reinforced pilot's compartment in the 
    power armor, so the Invid pilot inside will be blown to pieces.

<LI><B>PARTICLE BEAM CANNON</B>.  The main weapon of the Invid Sentinel is a
   compact but powerful particle beam cannon mounted on the right
   shoulder.  The cannon is mounted on a swiveling turret, and can move
   45 degrees downward, 90 degrees upward, and 45 degrees to either
   side.  It cannot point behind the mecha.<P>

   </UL><P>

<LI><B>(OPTIONAL) ENERGY RIFLE</B>.  This hand-held energy rifle is identical to
   the one used by the old Enforcer mecha.  When held, it patches into
   the Sentinel's energy supply for power.  The rifle can be attached to
   the back of the mecha when not in use.<P>
   <UL>
   <LI><B>Primary Purpose</B>: Assault/Defense
   <LI><B>Range</B>: 2000 ft (609 m)

     parry and can be used to parry/block energy blasts and mini-
     missiles.  Size: 4 ft (1.2 m) round.  M.D.C. capability (150
     M.D.C.) can be recharged at a rate of 20 M.D.C. per hour.
   <LI><B>Note</B>: The shield can NOT function unless attached to the body armor.
     The Sentinel armor can NOT be modified for human use.
   </UL><P>

<LI><B>HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT</B>.  The mecha's powerful reflexes makes the
   Sentinel a good hand-to-hand combatant.<P>
   <UL>
   <LI><B>Attacks Per Melee</B>: Four
   <LI><B>Hand to Hand Bonuses</B>: +2 to strike, +2 to parry (+5 with shield), +3
     to dodge on the ground, +4 to dodge when flying at any speed, +4
