<IMG ALIGN=left WIDTH=232 HEIGHT=396 SRC="./Images/renegade.gif">
<I>"Look, mentally I'm older than Lincoln, emotionally I'm six years old,
physically I look like I'm in my twenties, my hormones are going top
speed, and I'm something evolved from a slug evolved into something
evolved from an ape.  And YOU got the nerve to say YOU'RE confused?!?"</I>
<BR><B>Kayagh</B>, Renegade Stage 5 Invid
<P>
Traditionally members of the Invid race have had a strong hive-mentality.  To 
the Invid, there was no "self", only an overwhelming devotion to the Regis and
the Invid collective.  This all changed however when the Regis began creating 
Invid in human form with human brain patterns.  For the first time in the 
history of the race, individual Invid began to think for themselves.  While 
this resulted in much more unpredictable and deadly fighters, it also caused a

problem that the Regis had not anticipated; humanoid Invid began to feel 
emotions such as love, hate, anger, and fear; emotions they had no idea how 
to deal with.  And as a result, again for the first time in Invid history, 
some Invid actually began to question the plans of the Regis!
<P>
Many stage 5 invid possess a certain amount of rebelliousness, but only a 
very few actually go so far as to disobey the Regis' directives and work 
against the Invid occupation forces.  Often these renegade Invid work by 
themselves, since there is still much distrust and hatred between them and 
the humans, but every once in a while both humans and invid will overcome 
their prejudices and work together against the stage 6 invid overlords.  
<P>
<B>NOTE</B>:  Renegade invid with the resistance are very rare, and 
likewise encounters with renegades should be extremely rare.  If 
the GM consents to letting a player play a renegade invid, then certainly no 
more than one invid per party should be allowed!

<B>R.C.C. SKILLS:</B>
<UL>
<LI>	Pilot Invid Battloids (65% + 5% per level of experience)

        Alpha Fighter)

</UL>
<OL>
<LI>May be upgraded to Martial Arts at the cost of one "other" skill.
<LI>These skills represent an invid's basic knowledge about protoculture 
    and the invid race in general.  Characters should use these skills when 
    attempting to answer a question that "any Invid should know," such as 
    invid tactics and hive designs.  GMs may overrule these skills if their 
    effects might be too damaging to the plot of the adventure.
</OL>
<DL>
<DT><B>OTHER SKILLS:</B>
<DD>Select 10 other skills.  Plus two at third level, two at sixth level, and 
one at tenth level.  All new skills start at level one proficiency.  Note 
that some skills must be taught by humans before any invid can gain the skill;
it is highly unlikely that a stage 5 invid who has just gone rogue will know 
computer programming.  Players and GMs should use common sense when 
determining what skills a renegade invid has.

        <B>Mecha Combat BASIC</B>.  All pilot skills MUST be taught by humans;
        they cannot be taken as initial skills.
<LI>	<B>Pilot Related:</B> Any (+5%)

<DT><B>SPECIAL RULE:</B> 
<DD>Inexperienced invid (or human) characters may elect to NOT fill all of 
their skill slots, and then claim them at a later time to represent skills 
learned during their adventures when their background can justify learning 
such skills.  Skills can only be claimed when a character gets enough 
experience to advance a level.  For example, a new renegade invid PC fills 5 
skill slots, leaving 5 blank.  When the character gains enough experience to 
advance to level 2, he chooses to take <B>Pilot Cyclone</B> and <B>Mecha 
Combat BASIC: Cyclone</B> as skills, using up 4 skill slots (see below).  He 
justifies this by saying that the veritech pilot he has been traveling with 
has taught him how to use "earther mecha".  The player still has 1 skill slot 
available for when he reaches level 3 or later.  This rule may also be used 
for human children or other inexperienced characters (i.e. "Annie").  Delayed 
skills start at level 1 proficiency when claimed.

 SRC="./Images/youngrook.gif">
The Invid Wars have been very hard on the general civilian 
population of Earth.  The democratic governments of the past have 
collapsed, and along with them almost all civil services such as 
police, hospitals, schools, etc.  Many people have given in to 
despair, and spend their days huddled in shelters or under rubble 
praying that everything will go away.  Others have 
adapted and learned to live in the harsh new world, becoming 
stronger and more resiliant (and more brutal) in order to survive 
in a land where "might makes right".  Many of these survivors have 
banded together into gangs, working together for mutual protection.  
Some gangs are actually benevolent, ruling the cities they inhabit
with a fair (if cold) hand.  But by far the majority of them
are cruel and criminal, raping and pillaging towns for their own 
pleasure and survival.  The lowest have even thrown in with the Invid, 
and now work as pawns of their overlords.  These Invid sympathizer 
gangs (called <A HREF="./frags.html"><B>FRAGS</B></A>) are 
particularly dangerous, as they actively hunt down dissidents and 
resistance fighters for their Invid masters.
<P>
Sometimes gangers will become disillusioned with their fellow 
gang members and seek to escape.  Leaving a gang is not hard; all one 
needs to do is sneak out of their city and into the wastelands 
that surround them.  Often these ex-gangers will hook up with 
resistance fighters or rebels and work together for something 
better.  Although usually young, poor, and uneducated, these 
warriors bring with them survival skills that are invaluable to a 
party travelling in the destroyed cities and urban wastelands of Earth.

<P>
<IMG ALIGN=right WIDTH=216 HEIGHT=282 VSPACE=3 SRC="./Images/paramedic.gif">
The REF Combat Paramedic is a highly-trained medical specialist who is a vital
part of the REF Military.  While not as experienced or as knowledgable as a
true Medical Doctor, the paramedic is trained in all forms of emergency
medicine and is familiar with triage medical practices and addressing critical
life-threatening wounds.  More importantly, the Combat Paramedic is
experienced in military tactics and can defend himself/herself in the field as
well as keep pace with other military units.  In terms of medicine, the
paramedic is qualified to perform everything up through simple surgery and
common medical procedures (appendectomies, shrapnel removal, delivering
babies, etc.) but is not experienced in more advanced areas such as combatting
viruses or brain surgery.  The main focus of the Combat Paramedic's training
is to keep a wounded soldier alive and stable until he can be evacuated to a
field hospital.
<P>
The Combat Paramedic is typically a resourceful individual who thinks fast and
can make due with limited resources.  He/she will typically try to avoid
combat and bloodshed (it goes against his/her hippocratic oath) but also
realizes that sometimes it is necessary to use lethal force to defend one's
self and loved ones.  The paramedic is trained in combat tactics, however, and
can hold his/her own in a fight.  Combat Paramedics are highly sought after
among resistance groups on Earth during the Third Invid War.  They provide
invaluable services in a world where combat is common, swift and deadly and
trained medical staff are virtually nonexistant.
<P>
REF Combat Paramedics recieve Cyclone Basic training as part of their REF
training, and are usually issued a <A HREF="./vr117.html"><B>VR-117

<P>
The REF Military Police (REF MP) is the expeditionary force's version of the 
Southern Cross Global Military Police.  Like the GMP, the REF MP is an elite 
intelligence and law enforcement division that maintains order within REF 
forces and ensures that robotechnology is never compromised or abused.  REF MP 
agents are stationed on all ships and bases in the expeditionary force.  
Although they share the same facilities and use the same mecha as the regular 
troops, they have their own reporting structure and are answerable only to 
their MP superiors and the REF high command.  
<P>
REF Military Police officers are heavily trained in forensic arts such as
tracking, investigation, and interrogation.  They are also extensively drilled
in hand-to-hand and modern firearm combat skills so that they can hold their
own in combat when necessary.  They are given basic familiarity training in 
most REF mecha but are specifically trained to use 
<A HREF="newcyclones.html">REF Cyclones</A> and 
<A HREF="../Garland/garland.html">Southern Cross Garlands</A>.  REF MP officers
are also experienced in crowd control measures, and are even skilled in 
emergency medical skills to care for injured persons until paramedics can 
arrive.
<P>
Like their counterparts in the GMP, REF Military Police are given top security
clearance, access to special items and mecha, and the freedom to act under 
their own discretion during an investigation.  Because of this preferential
treatment most of the standard REF soldiers consider the REF MP to be snobbish
and arrogant.  However, the majority of REF MP officers are loyal, dependable 
and trustworthy soldiers who strongly believe in the principles of the REF.

Ever since the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, construction engineers have been 
a vital part of the armed forces, building (or blowing up) bridges, bases, and

other structures to aid in the accomplishment of a military objective.  Army 
Engineers also act as "sappers," using special equipment to clear areas of 
land mines and booby-traps.  In peacetime, combat engineers perform civilian 
works, such as building dams (such as Bagnall Dam in Missouri) and work to 
avert disasters such as earthquakes and flooding.
<P>
The services of a combat engineer are a much-needed commodity during the 
Invid occupation of Earth.  Many buildings and fortifications are half-ruined,
and only skilled construction workers can repair them.  The Resistance can 
always use the services of a military engineer to help defeat fortifications 
made by the Invid, and pay on individual jobs can often be astounding.

<H3>CIVILIAN CONSTRUCTION ENGINEER</H3></A>
<I>(For TIW/Sentinels, but adaptable to Macross and Southern Cross)</I>
<P>
The civilian engineer could be called the equivalent of the combat engineer 
but employed in the private sector.  These individuals are often placed in 
command of groups of laborers working on construction projects.  Starting 
out, these engineers are sub-contractors to one or more levels of higher-level

construction engineers, who are in turn subcontractors to contracting 
companies.  As they gain more experience, the engineers advance upward, 
getting more men (and subcontractors) under their command.  Eventually, they 
may become the heads of their own contracting organizations, passing on 
contracts to subordinate (lower-level) engineers.
<P>
In any Robotech era, construction engineers will usually never lack for a job.
But in the Macross and Invid wars era in particular, when reconstruction was 
commencing at a startling rate, construction engineers are particularly 
sought-after, with even the lowest-level engineer receiving astounding 
salaries (up to ten times the base) from groups such as E.B.S.I.S. and RDF.
