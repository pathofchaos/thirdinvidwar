<H3>INVID BODY ARMOR</H3></A>
<IMG WIDTH=432 HEIGHT=298 SRC="./Images/invidarmor.gif"><P>
Early on during the Third Invid War the stage 6 Invid began examining 
the mecha and tactics of REF personnel and freedom fighters that were 
fighting them.  Inevitably the leader Invid started to emulate the 
resistance, building their own versions of some of the tools and 
equipment commonly used by the humans.  One of the earliest pieces of 
human technology to be copied was the CVR-3 Cyclone Body Armor, which 
resulted in a new type of Invid Body Armor for use by stage 5 and stage 
6 Invid.  
<P>
Like the CVR-3 Armor, the Invid Body Armor is a durable and lightweight 
containment suit that covers the entire body.  However, the Invid Armor 
is made up mostly of chitin-like ceramic alloys and plates instead of 
the metal and kevlar of the REF version.  There are two different 
versions of the body armor, one for the stage 5 Invid and one for the 
stage 6 Invid.  The stage 6 version is slightly stronger and offers 
better protection than the stage 5 version, but otherwise the suits are 
identical.  There are also slightly different version for male and 
female Invid.  Note that unlike the Invid Enforcer and Sentinel mecha, 
the body armors are NOT powered exoskeletons and do not increase the 
strength of the wearer.  Like their REF counterparts, humanoid Invid 
pilots often wear body armor while piloting their mecha in order to have 
an additional level of protection from damage.
<P>
Invid Body Armors provides the following benefits:

<B>Standard Features (Both Versions):</B>
<UL>
<LI>The ceramic plates of the armor are laser resistant; lasers do 1/2 damage.
<LI>Complete Environmental Battle Armor suitable for use in space or 
   other hostile environments.
<LI>Automatic life support system that maintains atmosphere, 
   temperature, and humidity for the wearer.  The armor has an organic 
   filter system that will allow it to provide air indefinitely in 
   polluted or contaminated atmospheres.  There is also a backup air 
   supply that can supply atmosphere for 8 hours in a vacuum.
<LI>Fire resistant up to 300 degrees centigrade.  Normal fires do no 
   damage, but plasma and nuclear fires have full effect.
<LI>Radiation shielded.
<LI>Helmet has light-sensitive irises that automatically adjust in 
   bright light to prevent blindness.  The organic optical system can 
   also provide low-light and infrared viewing upon request.
</UL>
Invid Body Armor CAN be worn by a human or humanoid, providing the 
wearer with all of the advantages listed above.  However, the wearer 
will NOT be able to fool other Invid into believing that he is a stage 5 
or stage 6 Invid.  Invid communicate by telepathy and will be able to 
quickly detect if the wearer is not Invid.

<A NAME="pistol">
<H3>INVID TYPE II ENERGY PISTOL</H3></A>
Like the CVR-3 Body Armor, the stage 6 Invid also emulated some of the 
hand weapons of the resistance fighters.  Although they already had a 
simple energy pistol for use by humanoid Invid, the leader Invid came up 
with additional weapons for use in the field or outside of their mecha.
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT BORDER=2 HSPACE=3  SRC="./Images/invidpistol.gif">
The Type II Pistol is a  more compact version of the older Invid energy 
blaster (see Invid Invasion page 77), designed to be the new standard 
handgun for humanoid Invid.  Most stage 5 and stage 6 Invid will have a 
pistol of this type on them at all times.  Like the Gallant H90, this 
pistol can be converted from an SDC weapon to an MDC weapon with a 
simple flick of a switch.  The Energy Pistol is powered by a special 
protoculture cell and is NOT compatible with energy clips.

<IMG ALIGN=LEFT BORDER=2 HSPACE=3  SRC="./Images/invidrifle.gif">
A heavier weapon used by stage 4 (unarmored), stage 5, and stage 6 
Invid.  Like the Type II Pistol, this energy rifle can also do varying 
amounts of damage.  However, more power levels are offered, including a 
stun version for the capture of live specimens/prisoners.  The Energy 
Rifle is powered by a special protoculture cell and is NOT compatible 
with energy clips.

<IMG ALIGN=LEFT BORDER=2 HSPACE=3  SRC="./Images/invidshield.gif">
This is a smaller version of the energy shield carried by the Invid 
Enforcer and Sentinel mecha.  The shield is oval in shape and is 3 feet 
long by 1 foot wide.  The shield resembles some of the shields used by 
Southern Cross troops.  Like the pistol and the rifle, the Energy Shield 
is powered by a special protoculture cell and is NOT compatible with 
energy clips.
