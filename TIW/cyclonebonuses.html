<H1>CYCLONE COMBAT BONUSES</H1>
<IMG ALIGN=right WIDTH=216 HEIGHT=264 SRC="./Images/protector.gif">
With the introduction of the second generation of cyclone designs there are
now many different designs to choose from, all with slightly different
abilities, strengths, and weaknesses.  Likewise, the bonuses from cyclone
combat training will be slightly different for each model.  There are still
only two skills for cyclone training, <B>Cyclone Combat Training</B> and
<B>Cyclone Combat BASIC Training</B>.  Due to the similar design of all
cyclones and the basic nature of the control systems for all models anyone
with one of these skills can pilot ALL types of cyclones with no penalty.
<P>
In order to determine the bonuses a character gets from cyclone training,
consult the two tables below.  The first lists general bonuses that a
character earns from a specific training skill regardless of which cyclone
model he is piloting.  Then look at the second table to get a list of the
specific bonuses associated with the model of cyclone the character is
piloting.  All skills and bonuses are exclusive; a character can have Cyclone
Combat <I>or</I> Cyclone Basic training, but not both skills to try and
combine bonuses.
<P>
Remember, these bonuses are in addition to the pilot's own hand to hand
training and attribute bonuses, but apply ONLY when piloting a cyclone.  These
mecha combat bonuses do not apply to the pilot's physical abilities when
outside the mecha.
<P>
<B>NOTE:</B> Changing modes from motorcycle to battloid or vice versa counts
as one attack/action for a melee round.
