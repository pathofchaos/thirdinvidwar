<H2>BACKGROUND</H2>
The <B><I>Warrior</I>-class Destroyer</B> was designed and built by the
Robotech Expeditionary Force (REF) in 2024, during the early part of the
Sentinels War (First Invid War).  Along with the <I>Exeter</I>-class Escorts,
the Warriors were designed to defend REF bases as well as escort larger
capital ships to protect against Invid strike forces.  The destroyers were
also designed for reconnaissance, and contain both powerful sensor systems and
subspace transmitters/receivers for their size.  The Warrior class has a
definite Zentraedi look and feel to it, mostly due to the fact that a large
number of its systems were taken directly from the Zentraedi <I>Salan</I>
scout ship design.  The use of Zentraedi technology greatly reduced the
development time necessary for the destroyers, as well as lowering the cost of
their manufacture since the Valivarre shipyards were already geared for
manufacturing these systems and did not require extensive retooling.
<P>
The armament of the Warrior-class destroyer is impressive for its size.  The
main weaponry consists of two forward-mounted main laser cannons along with 8
concealed particle beam cannons.  The destroyer also has six heavy missile
launchers (4 forward, 2 reverse) capable of launching nuclear or reflex
weaponry.  As with all REF starships designed following the near-defeat at the
battle of Tirol, the Warrior also has 20 retractable laser turrets and 4
retractable medium-range missile launchers for anti-mecha defense.  In
addition, the destroyer's modest landing bay can support up to 30 mecha of
various types, along with 3 shuttles and other support craft.  The Warrior
also contains a pinpoint barrier system, as well as its own independent fold
drive.
<P>
Although not as glamorous as other REF starships, the Warriors played an
important part during the First Invid War providing valuable reconnaissance
and defending REF bases against counterattacks as the Sentinels recaptured
local group planets from the Regent's forces.  During the final push to Optera
near the end of the war many Warriors took part in border raids to disrupt
Invid supply lines as well as diversionary skirmishes to keep Invid forces
away from the main fleet.  Many Warriors were destroyed during the final
battles of the war, though their sacrifices led to the Sentinels' triumph and
the death of the Invid Regent in 2032.
<P>
The Warrior-class destroyers were extremely popular with REF Zentraedi forces
and even some important non-Zentraedi REF commanders.  Following the end of
the Sentinels War <B>Colonel Jonathan Wolff</B> took command of the <B><I>RSS
Wolfpack</I></B> and made it the flagship of the REF Venus Attack Group, which
was the first and only time a starship smaller than a cruiser has been made
flagship of an entire REF fleet.  However, the <I>Wolfpack</I> was hijacked by
<B>Dana Sterling</B> and the 15th ATAC shortly after Wolff's arrival at Earth
and returned to Tirol with refugees from the Second Robotech War.  Dana
Sterling was court-martialed for her actions and the <I>Wolfpack</I> was
reassigned to the REF Mercury Defense Group to protect Tirol.  In 2042 the
<I>Wolfpack</I> was assigned to the Icarus Reconnaissance Mission and returned
to the Sol system once again.  Unfortunately the ship was destroyed shortly
after arrival by the <A HREF="./spacehive.html">Invid Space Hive</A> ring
while trying to regain contact with REF Moon Base Copernicus.
<P>
The Warrior class served until 2057 when the class was retired in favor of
newer RGF starship designs.  Most of the destroyers that survived the Invid
Wars were scrapped and recycled, although a few have been preserved.  The
<I>RSS Archer</I> is the most notable surviving example of this class, and is
currently on display in the RGF Naval Museum orbiting Tirol.  Warriors were
originally manufactured at the Fantoma Orbiting Shipyards, though later they
were also manufactured under contract at the Karbarran Space Works.  At their
height Warriors were manufactured at a rate of 15-20 per year.

<B>NOTES:</B>
<OL>
<LI>Depleting the MDC of the main body will eliminate the destroyer.  All 
    internal systems will shut down, including life support and internal 
    gravity.  In addition, there is a 40% chance that the power systems will
    overload and the destroyer will explode, doing 1D6x1,000 M.D. to 
    everything in a 2,000 ft (610 m) radius.  Regardless of whether it 
    explodes or not, the ship itself will be an unsalvageable floating 
    wreck.
<LI>Destroying the forward bridge will instantly kill anyone on the command
    deck.  However, there is an auxiliary bridge near the center of the ship
    that the surviving crew can take command from.  If the main bridge is
    lost the ship will be operating at -2 initiative due to having to rely
    on backup systems.
<LI>Destroying the flight decks will greatly impair the destroyer's ability to
    deploy and recover mecha.  Under normal circumstances the destroyer can 
    launch or recover 4 mecha per turn.  For every 300 points of damage the
    flight deck takes reduce this number by 1.  If the flight deck reaches 0
    MDC then it is <I>destroyed</I>; no mecha can be launched or recovered,
    40+(1D6x10)% of the flight crew will be killed, and any mecha that have
    already been launched will need to find another place to land.
<LI>Depleting the MDC of the main engines will force the ship to rely on its
    secondary engines.  Depleting the MDC of the main engines AND secondary
    engines will leave the ship adrift in space.  If in an atmosphere, the 
    ship will crash (destruction of the main engines will render the 
    antigravity system useless due to loss of power).
<LI>The Pinpoint Barriers regenerate at a rate of 1,250 MD per second (2,500
    MD per melee round).  If destroyed, a barrier will completely regenerate
    within four seconds (2 melee rounds).  See the <A HREF="#ppb">Pinpoint 
    Barrier System</A> entry for details.
<LI>Destruction of the 6 forward antennae will knock out most of the 
    destroyer's sensor systems.  Main radar will be limited to only 20 miles
    (32 km), and subspace sensors will be offline.  Destruction of the 2 main
    antennae will knock out hyperspace communications.

<OL>
<LI><B>MAIN LASER CANNONS (2):</B> The main anti-starship weapons of the 
    <I>Warrior</I>-class Destroyers are two zentraedi-style heavy laser 
    cannons mounted below and to the rear on each side of the main bridge.
    These lasers are fixed forward and can only fire at targets directly in
    front of the destroyer.  The lasers can be fired individually or at
    the same time; most commanders alternate between the two cannons to 
    compensate for the lasers' recharge delay.

<LI><B>PARTICLE BEAM CANNONS (8):</B> As a backup to the main laser cannons,
    The <I>Warrior</I> destroyers are equipped with 8 heavy particle beam 
    cannons mounted in concealed hardpoints on the bow of the ship.  These
    cannons have a limited range of motion; they can be adjusted 30 degrees
    to the left, right, above or below the centerline of the ship.  The 
    cannons are similar to the PBC-12 cannons used on the Mk VII Excalibur 
    destroids, but have a longer range and greater power.

<LI><B>HEAVY MISSILE LAUNCHERS (6):</B> To further augment their anti-warship
    firepower, the <I>Warrior</I> destroyers are equipped with 6 torpedo-like
    missile tubes.  Four of these tubes are aimed forward while two are 
    mounted to the rear.  The launchers contain long-range nuclear missiles 
    and are intended for use heavy combat only.

        melee rounds).  If loaded, all 6 tubes can fire at once for a volley 
        of 6 nuclear missiles (!).
    <LI><B>PAYLOAD:</B> A typical destroyer carries 30 missiles in 
        storage that can be readied for firing in about 30 minutes.  
        Additional missiles can be carried if deemed necessary, however.
    <LI><B>NOTE:</B> These missiles CANNOT be used by variable fighters.  Each

    </UL><P>
<LI><B>RETRACTABLE LASER TURRETS (20):</B> The destroyer has 20 retractable 
    laser turrets mounted at various strategic places along the hull.  These 
    short-range lasers are intended primarily for anti-mecha defense, but can 
    do moderate damage against enemy spacecraft that get too close.  When not 
    in use gun turrets are concealed within the hull underneath a sliding 
    hatch.  At most 10 lasers can be brought to bear on a single target.

    <LI><B>DAMAGE:</B> 1D6x20 M.D. each.  Several lasers can be directed to 
        fire in volleys of 3 or more.  A volley of 3 beams does 3D6x20 M.D., a
        volley of 6 beams does 6D6x20 M.D., and so on.  A full volley of 10 
        beams aimed at a single target does 1D6x200 M.D. (!) if it hits.
    <LI><B>RATE OF FIRE:</B> Each laser can fire once per melee, and can be 
        combined in any volley combination of 3 or more lasers, up to 10 
        lasers.  Volleys can be directed at different targets.
    <LI><B>PAYLOAD:</B> Unlimited.
    <LI><B>NOTE:</B> The lasers can be set on automatic during combat, during 
        which time they have a +2 to strike due to their advanced tracking 
        systems.  The lasers tracking systems will target incoming missiles 
        first and attacking mecha/aircraft second.

<LI><B>RETRACTABLE MEDIUM MISSILE LAUNCHERS (4):</B> In addition to the heavy 
    missile launchers, the <I>Warrior</I> destroyers are armed with four 
    medium range missile launchers which are also intended for anti-mecha 
    defense.  Each launcher contains 10 missile tubes allowing volleys of up 
    to 10 missiles to be fired at a single target per launcher.  Once 
    depleted, the missile launchers are reloaded by an automated loading 
    system that takes 15 seconds (one melee round) to reload all 10 
    missiles. Armor-piercing smart missiles are usually used to avoid chances 
    of friendly fighters being shot down by the missiles.

<LI><A NAME="ppb"><B>DS-1 PINPOINT BARRIER DEFENSE SYSTEM:</B></A> Originally 
    developed by Dr. Emil Lang onboard the SDF-1 during the First Robotech
    War, the Pinpoint Barrier System is a standard defense system on board
    most REF starships, including the <I>Warrior</I> destroyers.  The system
    generates four small disc-shaped force fields that can be positioned
    anywhere along the ship to deflect missiles, energy beams or projectiles.
    Each pinpoint barrier is about 200 ft (61 m) in length and can absorb up
    to 5,000 MD in damage, which then regenerates within five seconds (3 melee
    attacks).  The barriers can also be layered on top of each other to 
    generate a field which provides 20,000 MDC and can even deflect heavy 
    particle beams (usually).
    <P>
    The four barriers are controlled by operators in the command tower of the
    carrier.  These operators are instructed to defend (1) the forward 
    bridge, (2) main engines, (3) main weapon systems, and (4) the flight 
    deck, in that order.  The operators primarily concentrate on defending 
    the ship against larger spacecraft and leave defense against mecha 
    attacking the destroyer to the Veritechs and retractible weapon systems.
    <P><UL>
    <LI><B>PRIMARY PURPOSE:</B> Defense (the pinpoint barrier system cannot be
        used as a weapon)
    <LI><B>RANGE:</B> Up to 100 feet (30.5 m) from the surface of the vessel.
    <LI><B>DAMAGE CAPACITY:</B> Can sustain up to 5,000 MD per round. 
        Regenerates at a rate of 2,500 MD per melee round.
    <LI><B>RADIUS:</B> 200 ft (61 m)
    <LI><B>DEFENSIVE MOVEMENT:</B> Can move from one end of the destroyer to 
        the other in less than a single round.  Trained operators can attempt 
        to block attacks up to 8 times per melee (counts as a parry) and are 
        at +7 to block.  Untrained characters can parry up to their number of 
        hand-to-hand attacks with their normal parry bonuses only.
    <LI><B>PAYLOAD:</B> Nearly inexhaustible.  Will work as long as system is 
        functional (see below) and engines are intact.  If main engines are
        destroyed, the barrier will loose power and not function.
    <LI><B>NOTE:</B> If all four barriers are grouped in a single spot they
        can deflect a heavy particle beam attack, such as the one generated 
        by Zentraedi or Robotech Master warships.  However, the beam will 
        completely destroy all four barriers and put incredible strain on the 
        pinpoint barrier system to the point where it may short out.  After 
        deflecting an energy beam, roll percentile dice on the table below to 
        determine additional effects/damage.

<H3>SYSTEMS OF NOTE:</H3>
<UL>
<LI><B>ANTIGRAVITY PROPULSION SYSTEM:</B> The Warrior destroyers are
equipped with an anti-gravity propulsion system used for planetary landings
and liftoffs.  The system is good for vertical ascent/descent only and can
lift the ship at speeds of up to 1,320 feet (400 m) per minute.  The system
will function so long as the main engines can supply energy to it.
<LI><B>HYPERSPACE COMMUNICATIONS:</B> The destroyer is equipped with a
hyperspace communications relay which allows faster-than-light communication
between the ships and other vessels or planetary bases.  Hyperspace
communications are still not instantaneous, however.  Audio/video
communication travels through hyperspace at a rate of about 5 seconds per
light year, so messages communicated over vast distances can still take days,
weeks, or months to arrive.
<LI><B>LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEMS:</B> The Warrior destroyers have sufficient life
support to provide breathable air and comfortable temperatures for 500
people for up to 15 years (air is recycled).  In an emergency the life support
system can support up to 800 people at one time, though living conditions
onboard will get extremely cramped at that point.  The carrier also holds
sufficient food and water to support 400 people for up to 6 months.
<LI><B>LONG-RANGE LASER/SATELLITE RELAY COMMUNICATIONS:</B> The impressive 
communications array of the destroyer can communicate with up to 500
craft simultaneously at ranges of up to 900 miles (1,440 km).  This range can
be boosted indefinitely by using satellites or other spacecraft to relay
communications.
<LI><B>LONG-RANGE RADAR:</B> The radar array of the Warrior destroyers can 
track and identify up to 1,000 craft simultaneously.  The radar system has a 
2,000 mile/3,200 km range.
<LI><B>SPACE FOLD SYSTEM:</B> For FTL propulsion, the destroyer is
equipped with a modified version of a Zentraedi fold drive, capable of
propelling the ship through hyperspace at speeds up to 3.28x10^10 mps
(5.25x10^10 kmps), or 1 light year per 6 minutes.  However, unlike larger
capital ships the Warrior <B>CANNOT</B> transport other ships with it when it
folds.  The range of the fold drive is theoretically unlimited except by the
life expectancy of the spacecraft.
<LI><B>SUBLIGHT ENGINES:</B> As a backup to the Fold System, the destroyer
is equipped with sublight engines that can propel the ship at speeds up to
0.20 speed of light (32,000 miles/51,500 km per second) in space.  Note that
these engines are mainly intended for rapid movement inside a planetary system
and are not suited for long voyages between star systems.  In a planetary
atmosphere the carrier is limited to speeds of Mach 3 at low altitudes or Mach
8 at high altitudes due to hull stress.
<LI><B>SUBSPACE MASS SENSORS:</B> The Warrior destroyers are equipped
with subspace sensors which are based on the same principles as the
hyperspace communications array.  These sensors can essentially instantly
detect mass readings and movement of objects up to 1 AU (93 million miles)
distant from the carrier, and the readings are used both for early warning and
for navigation when travelling at sublight speeds.  Readings taken with the
subspace sensors are not very detailed (-25% penalty when trying to identify a
detected object) and cannot detect objects of less than 60,000 kg (this
includes most variable fighters).

<H3>MECHA COMPLEMENT:</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The landing bay can hold and support a grand total of 30 veritechs/destroids
of any type, as long as the mecha are smaller than 50 ft (15.2 m) and weigh
less than 40 tons each.  The actual complement of mecha will vary; A Warrior
destroyer assigned to escort or long-range reconnaissance will usually have 12
Alphas (VAF-6 or <A HREF="./vaf8.html">VAF-8</A>), 12 Betas (VBF-1 or <A
HREF="./vbf2.html">VBF-2</A>), and 6 Destroids (Gladiator, Excalibur, or
Raidar X) aboard, while a destroyer assigned to support an invasion may have 6
Alphas and 24 Destroids.  Other combinations are possible.  Also included are
50 <A HREF="./newcyclones.html">Cyclones</A>  of various types (for use by the
troops on board), 6 TCH-4 Tractor-Haulers, 12 ML-3 Forklifts, and 3 REF
Personnel Shuttles.
