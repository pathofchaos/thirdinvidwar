<H1>EXTRA EQUIPMENT FOR CYCLONES</H1>
During the Cyclone Redesign Project of 2039 REF engineers and REF Intelligence
took a close look at the capabilities of the Cyclones versus the missions they
were being assigned to.  Although the Cyclone was a marvelous mecha for
reconnaissance, hit-and-run, infiltration, and extraction missions, it tended
to be underpowered and underequipped for front-line confrontations with enemy
main battle mecha.  Often times 40-70% of a cyclone squadron would be
destroyed while accomplishing mission objectives, simply because their
armament and equipment was not sufficient to the tasks they were faced with. 
To combat this, the REF designed several different auxiliary units for use
with Cyclones to augment their capabilities.  The most common of these units
are listed below.

<H3>CA-101 CYCLONE RE-ENTRY SHIELD</H3></A>
The CA-101 was conceived and developed for the <B>Icarus Mission</B> by REF
Intelligence, who wanted a quick and quiet way to land cyclone-clad agents on
Earth to spy on Invid fortifications and troop movements.  The result of their
research was an external device that could allow a cyclone pilot to deploy
high in the atmosphere (or even in orbit) and reach the ground without burning
up in reentry.  The CA-101 initially looks like a large box with thrusters
that attaches to the back of any model cyclone like a backpack.  In use, the
cyclone rider is deployed at high altitudes and uses the cyclone's thrusters
to begin descent towards the Earth.  Then the pilot turns around so his back
is facing the ground, and activates the CA-101.  The pack immediately deploys
a series of canvas balloons that form an umbrella-shaped disk on the back of
the cyclone.  This umbrella is made of heat resistant materials and shields
the cyclone pilot, his mecha, and his equipment from damage during reentry. 
The thrusters on the CA-101 are used to slow the cyclone's descent.  Once the
cyclone is low enough in the atmosphere, the CA-101 automatically jettisons
the balloons and deploys a parachute to safely land the cyclone on the ground.
 The CA-101 contains chemical fuel and high-power batteries to power both its
onboard computer and the cyclone's life support systems, so the entire
procedure can be done while the cyclone's protoculture engine is turned off,
making the cyclone essentially invisible to Invid scanners.
<P>
The CA-101 was a tremendous success, and was used extensively during the Third
Invid War once the REF discovered that it was virtually impossible to
penetrate the Invid space defenses with their starships.  During the war Beta
fighters would be loaded with Cyclone troopers and then fly close enough to
the Earth to deploy the troopers, and then rocket away from earth before the
Invid Space Troopers could catch them.  Thousands of cyclone riders managed to
land on Earth this way during the war.  The CA-101 can be used by any cyclone,
old or new, without penalty.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>NOTE:</B> The CA-101 can be used only in battloid mode!  Should the cyclone
switch to motorcycle mode then the CA-101 will automatically pop off the back
of the mecha.

<P>
As the mobile infantry forces for the REF, Cyclone riders were often ordered
on rapid strike missions to help take out enemy fortifications and defenses in
advance of heavier forces (such as Veritechs and Destroids).  The cyclone's
incredible mobility made it ideal for these types of missions, but the light
armament of the mecha sometimes hindered the success of the mission.  To
combat this, REF engineers came up with a series of external heavy weapon
modules for use by cyclone forces during the Cyclone Redesign Project of 2039.
 In motorcycle mode these heavy weapons would be mounted on sidecars that
could travel fairly quickly along with the cyclone, and in battloid mode the
weapon would convert to an over-the-shoulder unit that increased the offensive
capabilities of the cyclone.
<P>
All HWS units have their own internal power supplies so as not to cause any
unnecessary drain on the cyclone's own engine system.  There are three
different HWS units; a particle cannon similar to the one used by the
Excalibur Destroid, a tri-barrel rapid-fire laser cannon similar to the one
used by the Raidar X, and a disruptor cannon similar to the one used by Shadow
Fighters.  Unfortunately due to size considerations, the HWS units use an
unshielded protoculture power system that can be easily detected by Invid
sensors when active.  Furthermore, because of their size and placement, the
ground and flight speeds of a cyclone were decreased by 15% while the HWS was
attached.  The units can be instantly detached from the cyclone mecha after
they have served their purpose.  Often one HWS of each type was assigned to a
cyclone infantry platoon (12 Cyclone riders) and the three cyclone riders who
used them became the heavy weapons squad of the platoon.

<B>CA-104 CYCLONE HEAVY WEAPONS SYSTEM (DISRUPTOR CANNON)</B></A>
<P>
The CA-104 is technologically the most advanced of the Cyclone HWS systems,
and is also the most costly to produce and maintain.  Because of these factors
very few CA-104 systems made it to Earth with the forces of the Icarus
Mission, and thus the HWS is VERY rare among resistance fighters.  Only the
largest and most organized of resistance groups (or the luckiest) even have a
chance of ever seeing one of these units.

<H3>CA-105 CYCLONE HIGH-DENSITY BATTERY PACK</H3></A>
Another invention of REF Intelligence, the CA-105 is an external battery pack
that allows a cyclone to operate at full capabilities without using the
protoculture engine for a short period of time.  This allows intelligence
agents to operate inside invid hives without fear of being spotted by their
protoculture emissions.  The CA-105 is a high-density heavy metal battery that
can store and supply a tremendous amount of electricity, enough to power a
cyclone for up to 1 hours by itself.  When used in conjunction with a
cyclone's fusion engine, it allows the mecha to operate at full capabilities
for 2 hours without using its protoculture engine.
<P>
The only disadvantage of the CA-105 is that the chemicals and metals used in
the battery are highly corrosive and explosive, and tend to explode if the
casing is breached.  The unit can supply enough energy to run a cyclone for 1
hour by itself, or 2 hours with help from the FF-600 fusion reactor.  Once
depleted it takes 36 hours to completely recharge the battery, which can only
be done using a cyclone fusion reactor or equivalent power source.  The
cyclone can NOT be used while it is recharging the battery.  The CA-105 is the
same size as a cyclone saddlebag and can be stored in place of either
saddlebag on the back of the mecha.  Two CA-105 battery packs can be used on
one cyclone to double the duration, at the price of sacrificing both
saddlebags.  ONLY second generation cyclones can use the CA-105 for stealth
purposes, though anyone can tap the battery as a source of energy.
<P>
<B>Note:</B> It is possible to significantly extend the life of the battery by
switching between fusion/battery power and fusion power only when full power
is not needed.  Using this technique the battery can typically supply power
for normal cyclone operation for up to 4 hours (8 hours with two batteries)
provided prolonged combat is avoided.  Switching between fusion only and
fusion/battery power (or activating the cyclone's protoculture generator)
takes one melee action.

<P>
<B>Note:</B> Destruction of the CA-105 will result in an explosion that does
1D6x10 M.D. to all objects in a 10 foot radius.  The cyclone the CA-105 is
attached to is automatically considered destroyed (engine system is wrecked),
though the pilot will usually be protected by the Cyclone's armor.

<H3>CA-106 "HOS-BOX" CYCLONE MEDICAL SIDECAR</H3></A>
The CA-106 was designed to provide good facilities for medical field work, in
cases where the victim cannot be moved, or even reached by normal ambulances. 
When used in conjunction with the <A HREF="./vr117.html"><B>VR-117 Firefly
Rescue Cyclone</B></A>, the CA-106 can provide superb emergency field care to
victims in even the worst of conditions.  The Medical Sidecar contains
diagnostic, surgical, and medical equipment, all of it microminiaturized and
packed compactly in place so that no space is wasted.  Because of its amazing
facilities (equal to those of a fair clinic--save vs. coma/death at 1-56%), it
has been nicknamed the "Hospital in a Box," or more simply, the "Hos-Box."
<P>
The Hos-Box sidecar is air-tight, shock resistant, and has mega-damage armor. 
When the Cyclone it is attached to converts to power armor mode, the sidecar's
single wheel retracts and a handle pops out of the top, so the armored Cyclone
Rider may carry the sidecar with him.  Though commonly issued only to the
VR-117 Firefly Cyclone, the Hos-Box is compatible with any model of Cyclone,
old or new, and with almost any motorcycle.
