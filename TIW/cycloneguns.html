<H1>CYCLONE HAND WEAPONS</H1>
A big strength of the cyclone mecha is that because it is a battlesuit and
not a full-sized mecha, it can use a variety of different hand weapons in
addition to its normal armaments.  Cyclone pilots can either use infantry
hand weapons such as the Gallant H-90 or Wolverine Assault Rifle, or can 
use larger anti-mecha weapons with the help of the Cyclone's hydraulics
and targeting systems.  The weapons below for the most part fit into the
latter category.  They were actually designed for the <A HREF="../Garland/garland.html"><I><B>Garland series 
cyclones</B></I></A> used by the Southern Cross just before and during the 
<I>Second Robotech War</I>.  Although somewhat rare after almost 12 years
of warfare, they can still be found from time to time and are a valuable
addition to cyclone infantry squads and terran resistance fighters.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>NOTE:</B> These weapons can easily be integrated into your Southern Cross 
or Invid Invasion campaigns even if you are not playing a full <I>Third 
Invid War</I> campaign.  They should be generally available on Earth any
time after the late 2020s / early 2030s, shortly before the arrival of the
Robotech Masters.  Stats for the <A HREF="../Garland/index.html"><B><I>Southern Cross Garland Cyclones</I></B></A> are available by clicking <A HREF="../Garland/index.html"><B>HERE</B></A>.

<B>GU-11S 55mm GUN POD</B></A><P>
<IMG ALIGN=left SRC="./Images/gu11s.gif">
This weapon is a variant of the original GU-11 Gun Pod 
used by the old VF-1 Veritechs of the Robotech Defense Force (RDF).  Smaller, 
with a shorter barrel and smaller ammo supply, the weapon was designed to be 
used by the smaller-scale battloids and garlands of the Southern Cross.  The 
weapon can be used by Cyclone riders, but looks a little out of scale for 
them; more like a three-barrel bazooka than a carbine.  Although popular because of 
it's strong punch, the weapon is becoming increasingly rare due to lack of 
55mm ammo.

<B>GU-18 23mm GUN POD</B></A><P>
<IMG ALIGN=left SRC="./Images/gu18.gif">
 A small handheld gun pod designed to be used by the series 
5 Garlands of the Southern Cross.  This handheld weapon is a fairly popular 
replacement for the EP-40 Pulse Beam Gun because of its non-reliance on 
protoculture energy supplies.  The gun itself is difficult to find due to its 
limited production, but ammo can frequently be found in the ruins of old SC 
bases and equipment caches.

<B>GU-19 35mm GUN POD</B></A><P>
<IMG ALIGN=left SRC="./Images/gu19.gif">
A non-protoculture, conventional ammunition version of the 
EP-37 Beam Cannon for the Cyclone mecha.  This weapon is EXTREMELY popular 
with resistance fighters, as it uses the same ammunition that the GU-XX Gun 
Pod (used on Alpha and Beta fighters) uses, allowing the Veritechs and 
Cyclones to share ammo when necessary.  The weapon can be used by humans 
without Cyclones, but is heavy and akward, and imposes a penalty of -3 to 
strike.

<LI><B>PAYLOAD:</B>
 Can fire 12 short bursts, 6 long bursts, or 3 full melee bursts per 
clip.  Note that although the bullets used by the GU-19 and GU-XX are the 
same, the clips themselves are different.  Therefore bullets must be unloaded 
from one clip and loaded into another if the two mecha are going to share 
ammo.

<B>N-1 NET LAUNCHER</B></A><P>
<IMG ALIGN=left SRC="./Images/n1net.gif">
A unique weapon developed for the <I>Global Military Police (GMP)</I> 
during the years before the Second Robotech War, this weapon fires a woven 
cable net about 10 feet in diameter.  The net is very strong, and breaking it 
requires the victim to do at least 20 MDC points of damage (total) to the net; 
each strand is only 1 MDC each, but many strands must be broken before the 
victim can be freed.  It will take 4D6 melees for a person to untangle himself 
or herself from the net.
<P>
The N-1 Net Gun was originally designed to help GMP agents capture fugitives
and suspects without a great risk of harming them (or their hostages).  
Due to this fact, this weapon is seldom used by terran resistance, as they
seldom desire to actually capture an Invid.  Instead, it is more commonly used
by <A HREF="./frags.html"><I>Frags</I></A> and other Invid sympathizers to 
capture resistance fighters and slaves for the Invid.

<LI><B>PRIMARY PURPOSE:</B> Capture
<LI><B>MEGA-DAMAGE:</B> None; see above.
<LI><B>RATE OF FIRE:</B> Single shot weapon.
<LI><B>RANGE:</B> 100 feet
<LI><B>PAYLOAD:</B>
 One shot per net canister.  Replacing a canister with a spare takes 2 
melee actions (1 to detach the old canister, and 1 to put a new one on).  
Reloading a canister after it has been used requires 2D6x10 minutes.

<B>GU-21 45mm RECOILLESS RIFLE (with optional N-2 NET LAUNCHER)</B></A><P>
<IMG ALIGN=left SRC="./Images/gu21.gif">
 A rather 
powerful and dangerous weapon developed for the Garland cyclones shortly before 
the arrival of the Robotech Masters.  This weapon is fairly rare and well 
sought after for it's destructive potential.  The GU-21 fires 45mm fin-
stabilized grenades, and can use several different types of grenades.  The 
weapon uses a unique ammo clip that can carry up to 3 different types of ammo, 
and can switch between those ammo types by flipping a switch on the back of 
the rifle.  The GU-21 ca use High Explosive Anti-Tank (HEAT), Fragmentation 
(FRAG), Smoke or Gas grenades.  The GU-21 can also be equipped with an 
external N-2 net launcher, which launches a net similar to the N-1 net gun.

<LI><B>MEGA-DAMAGE: HEAT:</B> 
2D4x10 M.D., FRAG: 1D6x10 M.D., Smoke or Gas: No Damage.  
The smoke grenades will block sight and infrared sensors, and the gas grenades 
may be loaded with drugs such as tear gas or sleeping gas.
<LI><B>RATE OF FIRE:</B> 
Single Shots only.  Number of shots per round is equal to

 Each clip contains up to 30 grenades, and the 30 grenades carried can 
be subdivided into groups of 10 of different types.  Switching types of 
grenades (by changing the switch at the end of the gun) takes 1 melee action.
