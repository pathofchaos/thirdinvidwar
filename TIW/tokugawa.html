<H2>BACKGROUND</H2>
The <B><I>Tokugawa</I>-class Cruiser</B> is the oldest terran capital ship
design still in service.  Initially designed in 2015 following the end of the
First Robotech War, the cruisers were intended to augment the RDF's minuscule
fleet of captured Zentraedi warships and provide greater protection for the
Sol system.  A total of 8 Tokugawa cruisers had been constructed at the RDF
Robotech Factory Satellite by the time of the <I>SDF-3 Pioneer</I>'s departure
in 2022.  5 cruisers and a number of Zentraedi vessels were assigned to the
Pioneer mission, while the other 3 were left behind in service to the Tactical
Armored Space Corps of the Southern Cross.  Due to their high cost of
operation only two additional Tokugawa cruisers were constructed following the
Pioneer mission's departure.  Unfortunately all 5 Tokugawa cruisers that
stayed behind were destroyed by the Robotech Masters in the Second Robotech
War (2031-2032).  
<P>
Meanwhile at Tirol the Tokugawa cruisers suffered from the same weaknesses
that the <I>SDF-3 Pioneer</I> did.  Anticipating combat with a large number of
Zentraedi warships, the cruisers were woefully unprepared for the sheer number
of Invid mecha they faced during the battle of Tirol.  Two of the five ships
were destroyed during the first battle of the Sentinels War (First Invid War),
and a third was destroyed during an Invid counterattack on Tirol in 2023.  The
remaining two ships, the <I>Tokugawa</I> and the <I>Hannibal</I>, underwent an
extensive refit at the Fantoma Orbiting Shipyards, and additional Tokugawa
cruisers began construction in 2024.  
<P>
Initially the Tokugawa-class cruisers were armed with 4 dual-barrel heavy
laser turrets (2 forward, 2 rear), 12 concealed Zentraedi-style laser cannons
in the front bow, and 4 heavy missile launcher tubes (2 forward, 2 rear). 
Following their conversions in 2024 the REF Tokugawas were upgraded to 6 heavy
laser turrets (4 forward, 2 rear), 16 concealed forward laser cannons, and 8
heavy missile launcher tubes (6 forward, 2 rear).  In addition badly-needed
anti-mecha weaponry was added in the form of 30 retractable laser cannons and
6 retractable missile turrets.  Finally hyperspace communications and a fold
drive system were added, making the vessel capable of travelling beyond a
planetary system and commanding an interstellar fleet.

The Tokugawa cruisers served well during the First Invid War as command ships
for REF fleets.  In 2032 the cruiser <I>Hannibal</I> under the command of
Major John Carpenter was dispatched to Earth to warn the United Earth
Government about the Robotech Masters.  Unfortunately by this time the Masters
were already at war with the Armies of the Southern Cross.  Alone and without
support, the <I>Hannibal</I> engaged two Robotech Master motherships in Earth
orbit and managed to destroy one by colliding with it after being mortally
wounded in battle.  Meanwhile back near Tirol the cruisers <I>Tokugawa</I>,
<I>Rutland</I> and <I>Jutland</I> joined the haydonite cruiser <I>Ark
Angel</I> and several other Sentinels vessels in the final assault on the
Invid Regent at Optera.  Unfortuantely that same year General T.R. Edwards
attempted a coup against the REF command and siezed control of the Tokugawa
cruisers <I>Saratoga</I> and <I>Ticonderoga</I>.  The <I>Ticonderoga</I> was
eventually recaptured by loyal REF troops, but the <I>Saratoga</I> was
destroyed along with the <I>Tokugawa</I> when the two ships collided above
Optera.  More tragedy struck when the cruisers <I>Farragut</I> and
<I>Challenger</I>, both assigned to Jonathan Wolff's <B>REF Venus Attack
Group</B>, failed to emerge from hyperspace when the fleet folded to the Sol
system.  These two ships are still listed as missing in the REF fleet roster. 
During the Third Invid War several Tokugawa cruisers were assigned to the
<B>REF Icarus Recon Mission</B>.  Unfortunately all of these cruisers were
destroyed by the <A HREF="./spacehive.html">Invid Space Hive</A> network
during recon missions and while attempting to get badly needed supplies to
resistance fighters on Earth.
<P>
Production rates for the Tokugawa cruisers fell as newer command cruisers such
as the <I>Ikazuchi</I> and <I>Icarus</I> classes were introduced.  Production
of Tokugawa cruisers finally ceased in 2054 with the commissioning of the
<I>RSS Endeavor</I>.  Although some Tokugawa cruisers have been scrapped, many
are still in service with the RGF fleet.  One of the most famous (or infamous)
of these is the <I>RSS Griffon</I>, a Tokugawa cruiser which has been
permanently assigned to Robotech Guardian Forces Intelligence (RGFI).  The
<I>Griffon</I> is painted all black and is rumored to have sensor and weapons
capabilities greater than any other ship in the RGF fleet.  Her exact
specifications and missions are closely-guarded RGFI secrets, but most RGF
personnel regard her presence as an extremely bad omen. 
<P>
Tokugawa cruisers were first produced at the RDF Factory Satellite in orbit
above Earth.  After 2024 they were produced at the Fantoma Orbiting Shipyards
near Tirol, and later at the Karbarran Space Works and the REF Factory
Satellite.  At their height Tokugawas were manufactured at a rate of 4 per
year.

<B>NOTES:</B>
<OL>
<LI>Depleting the MDC of the main body will eliminate the cruiser.  All 
    internal systems will shut down, including life support and internal 
    gravity.  In addition, there is a 30% chance that the power systems will
    overload and the destroyer will explode, doing 4D6x1,000 M.D. to 
    everything in a 5,000 ft (1,525 m) radius.  Regardless of whether it 
    explodes or not, the ship itself will be an unsalvageable floating 
    wreck.
<LI>Destroying the command tower will instantly kill anyone on the bridge, 
    as well as knock out radar and primary communications.  There are two 
    auxiliary bridges in the main body of the ship that the surviving crew
    can take command from.  However if the command tower is lost then the
    ship will be at -5 initiative and -3 to dodge due to loss of sensors.
<LI>Depleting the MDC of the engineering section will essentially destroy
    the cruiser.  All power systems, the main engines and the auxiliary
    engines will be eliminated (see below).  In addition, all internal 
    systems will shut down due to lack of power, including life support 
    and internal gravity.  Finally, there is a 50% chance that the reflex 
    furnace will overload and explode, doing 4D6x1,000 M.D. to 
    everything in a 5,000 ft (1,525 m) radius.
<LI>Destroying the flight decks will greatly impair the cruiser's ability to
    deploy and recover mecha.  Under normal circumstances the destroyer can 
    launch or recover 10 mecha per turn.  For every 500 points of damage the
    flight deck takes reduce this number by 1.  If the flight deck reaches 0
    MDC then it is <I>destroyed</I>; no mecha can be launched or recovered,
    40+(1D6x10)% of the flight crew will be killed, and any mecha that have
    already been launched will need to find another place to land.
<LI>Depleting the MDC of the main engines will force the ship to rely on its
    auxiliary engines.  Depleting the MDC of the main engines AND auxiliary
    engines will leave the ship adrift in space.  If in an atmosphere, the 
    ship will crash (destruction of the main engines will render the 
    antigravity system useless due to loss of power).
<LI>The Pinpoint Barriers regenerate at a rate of 1,250 MD per second (2,500
    MD per melee round).  If destroyed, a barrier will completely regenerate
    within four seconds (2 melee rounds).  See the <A HREF="#ppb">Pinpoint 
    Barrier System</A> entry for details.

<LI><B>DUAL-BARREL HEAVY LASER TURRETS (4 initially, 6 after 2023):</B> The 
    main weapons of the Tokugawa cruisers are zentraedi-style turreted 
    heavy laser cannons.  Originally the cruisers mounted four turrets (two
    near the center above the main body, two on the rear engineering section)
    but following the 2023 refit two additional turrets were added (one on
    either side of the command tower).  Each turret can rotate 360 degrees

<LI><B>CONCEALED ZENTRAEDI-STYLE LASER CANNONS (12 initially, 16 after 
    2023):</B> As a backup to the main laser cannons and useful for heavy
    assaults, the Tokugawa cruisers are equipped with concealed lasers on
    the bow of the ship, similar to those used on Zentraedi cruisers.  These
    lasers have a limited range of motion; they can be adjusted 30 degrees
    to the left, right, above or below the centerline of the ship.  Initially
    12 lasers were mounted on the bow of the Tokugawa, but after the 2023 
    refit this number was raised to 16.

    pointing forward and two pointing rearward, but after the 2023 refit 
    an additional 4 forward-pointing tubes were added.  The launchers contain 
    long-range nuclear missiles and are intended for use in heavy combat only.

<LI><B>RETRACTABLE LASER TURRETS (30, not added until after 2023):</B> During 
    the 2023 refit retractable laser turrets were added to the Tokugawa 
    cruisers to provide better protection from Invid mecha attacks.  These
    lasers were placed at strategic positions along the hull and were 
    primarily intended for anti-mecha defense, but can do moderate damage 
    against enemy spacecraft that get too close.  When not in use gun turrets 
    are concealed within the hull underneath a sliding hatch.  At most 15 
    lasers can be brought to bear on a single target.

    turrets were added to the Tokugawa cruisers in 2023 to further augment
    their anti-mecha defenses.  Each launcher contains 8 missile tubes 
    allowing volleys of up to 8 missiles to be fired at a single target per 
    launcher.  Once depleted, the missile launchers are reloaded by an 
    automated loading system that takes 15 seconds (one melee round) to reload

    all 8 missiles. Armor-piercing smart missiles are usually used to avoid

<LI><A NAME="ppb"><B>DS-1 PINPOINT BARRIER DEFENSE SYSTEM:</B></A> Originally 
    developed by Dr. Emil Lang onboard the SDF-1 during the First Robotech
    War, the Pinpoint Barrier System is a standard defense system on board
    most REF starships, including the Tokugawa cruisers.  The system
    generates four small disc-shaped force fields that can be positioned
    anywhere along the ship to deflect missiles, energy beams or projectiles.
    Each pinpoint barrier is about 200 ft (61 m) in length and can absorb up
    to 5,000 MD in damage, which then regenerates within five seconds (3 melee
    attacks).  The barriers can also be layered on top of each other to 
    generate a field which provides 20,000 MDC and can even deflect heavy 
    particle beams (usually).
    <P>
    The four barriers are controlled by operators in the command tower of the
    carrier.  These operators are instructed to defend (1) the command 
    tower, (2) main engines, (3) flight deck, and (4) weapons systems 
    in that order.  The operators primarily concentrate on defending 
    the ship against larger spacecraft and leave defense against mecha 
    attacking the destroyer to the Veritechs and retractible weapon systems.
    <P><UL>
    <LI><B>PRIMARY PURPOSE:</B> Defense (the pinpoint barrier system cannot be
        used as a weapon)
    <LI><B>RANGE:</B> Up to 100 feet (30.5 m) from the surface of the vessel.
    <LI><B>DAMAGE CAPACITY:</B> Can sustain up to 5,000 MD per round. 
        Regenerates at a rate of 2,500 MD per melee round.
    <LI><B>RADIUS:</B> 200 ft (61 m)
    <LI><B>DEFENSIVE MOVEMENT:</B> Can move from one end of the destroyer to 
        the other in less than a single round.  Trained operators can attempt 
        to block attacks up to 8 times per melee (counts as a parry) and are 
        at +7 to block.  Untrained characters can parry up to their number of 
        hand-to-hand attacks with their normal parry bonuses only.
    <LI><B>PAYLOAD:</B> Nearly inexhaustible.  Will work as long as system is 
        functional (see below) and engines are intact.  If main engines are
        destroyed, the barrier will loose power and not function.
    <LI><B>NOTE:</B> If all four barriers are grouped in a single spot they
        can deflect a heavy particle beam attack, such as the one generated 
        by Zentraedi or Robotech Master warships.  However, the beam will 
        completely destroy all four barriers and put incredible strain on the 
        pinpoint barrier system to the point where it may short out.  After 
        deflecting an energy beam, roll percentile dice on the table below to 
        determine additional effects/damage.
        <UL>
        <LI><B>01-15:</B> Lucked out, system will be operational in 1D6 hours.
        <LI><B>16-30:</B> Minor damage, system will require 4D6 hours to
                          repair.
        <LI><B>31-45:</B> Major damage, system will require 2D6x10 hours to
                          repair (yes, DAYS of work).
        <LI><B>46-60:</B> Completely destroyed!  System can be rebuilt, but
                          will require new parts and 2D6 DAYS of work to 
                          replace.
        <LI><B>61-75:</B> Major damage, system will require 2D6x10 hours to
                          repair.
        <LI><B>76-90:</B> Minor damage, system will require 4D6 hours to
                          repair.
        <LI><B>91-95:</B> Lucked out, system will be operational in 1D6 hours.
        <LI><B>96-00:</B> It's a miracle!  Trivial damage only, system will 
                          be operational again in only 4D6 melee rounds!

<H3>SYSTEMS OF NOTE:</H3>
<UL>
<LI><B>ANTIGRAVITY PROPULSION SYSTEM:</B> The Tokugawa cruisers are
equipped with an anti-gravity propulsion system used for planetary landings
and liftoffs.  The system is good for vertical ascent/descent only and can
lift the ship at speeds of up to 1,320 feet (400 m) per minute.  The system
will function so long as the main engines can supply energy to it.
<LI><B>HYPERSPACE COMMUNICATIONS:</B> The cruiser is equipped with a
hyperspace communications relay which allows faster-than-light communication
between the ships and other vessels or planetary bases.  Hyperspace
communications are still not instantaneous, however.  Audio/video
communication travels through hyperspace at a rate of about 5 seconds per
light year, so messages communicated over vast distances can still take days,
weeks, or months to arrive.
<LI><B>LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEMS:</B> The Tokugawa cruisers have sufficient life
support to provide breathable air and comfortable temperatures for 2,500
people for up to 15 years (air is recycled).  In an emergency the life support
system can support up to 5,000 people at one time, though living conditions
onboard will get extremely cramped at that point.  The cruiser also holds
sufficient food and water to support 2,500 people for up to 6 months.
<LI><B>LONG-RANGE LASER/SATELLITE RELAY COMMUNICATIONS:</B> The impressive 
communications array of the cruiser can communicate with up to 500
craft simultaneously at ranges of up to 900 miles (1,440 km).  This range can
be boosted indefinitely by using satellites or other spacecraft to relay
communications.
<LI><B>LONG-RANGE RADAR:</B> The radar array of the Tokugawa cruisers can 
track and identify up to 500 craft simultaneously.  The radar system has a 
2,000 mile/3,200 km range.
<LI><B>SPACE FOLD SYSTEM:</B> Following 2023 the Tokugawa cruiser was
equipped with a Robotech Research Group fold drive, capable of
propelling the ship through hyperspace at speeds up to 3.28x10^10 mps
(5.25x10^10 kmps), or 1 light year per 6 minutes.  When executing a space fold
the cruiser will transport any ships within a 2 mile (3.2 km) radius with it,
allowing it to transport up to about 100 smaller ships with it, if necessary. 
The range of the fold drive is theoretically unlimited except by the life
expectancy of the spacecraft.
<LI><B>SUBLIGHT ENGINES:</B> As a backup to the Fold System, the cruiser
is equipped with sublight engines that can propel the ship at speeds up to
0.16 speed of light (25,600 miles/41,200 km per second) in space.  Note that
these engines are mainly intended for rapid movement inside a planetary system
and are not suited for long voyages between star systems.  In a planetary
atmosphere the carrier is limited to speeds of Mach 6 at low altitudes or Mach
10 at high altitudes due to hull stress.
<LI><B>SUBSPACE MASS SENSORS:</B> The Tokugawa cruisers are equipped
with subspace sensors which are based on the same principles as the
hyperspace communications array.  These sensors can essentially instantly
detect mass readings and movement of objects up to 1 AU (93 million miles)
distant from the carrier, and the readings are used both for early warning and
for navigation when travelling at sublight speeds.  Readings taken with the
subspace sensors are not very detailed (-25% penalty when trying to identify a
detected object) and cannot detect objects of less than 60,000 kg (this
includes most variable fighters).

<H3>MECHA COMPLEMENT:</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<IMG SRC="Images/tokugawa-airlock.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="197" HEIGHT="185"
BORDER="2">
The landing bay can hold and support a grand total of 350 veritechs/destroids
of any type, as long as the mecha are smaller than 50 ft (15.2 m) and weigh
less than 40 tons each.  In addition, there are 3 special berths for larger
mecha up to 100 ft (30.4 m) tall and 300 tons in weight (i.e. Mac II or III). 
Below are some typical mecha complements, though changes may be made if
required by the mission.
