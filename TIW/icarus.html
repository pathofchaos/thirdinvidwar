<H2>BACKGROUND</H2>
On August 12, 2037 the <I>Starlift</I>-class transport <I>RSS Cipolla</I>
suffered a severe thruster malfunction while resupplying the
<I>Ikazuchi</I>-class command cruiser <I>RSS Icarus</I>.  The Cipolla lost
control during docking maneuvers and slammed into the Icarus' docking bay,
exploding on impact.  The explosion caused massive damage to the interior of
the Icarus and ignited raging fires within the ship that took 38 hours for
emergency repair crews to bring under control.  Over 800 people on the Icarus
and the entire crew of the Cipolla lost their lives in the disaster. 
Following the incident the burnt-out hulk of the Icarus was towed back to the
Fantoma Orbiting Shipyards for repairs.  Unfortunately the massive damage
meant that the command cruiser would not be available for the REF Jupiter
Mission, which was being sent to retake Earth from the Invid Regis in 2038. 
The Icarus was left alone in drydock for approximately 11 months while all
resources were directed towards preparing the Jupiter Attack Fleet.  Finally,
in August of 2038 following the end of the Second Invid War work resumed on
the broken hull of the ship.
<P>
REF engineers decided to extensively redesign the Icarus and equip the ship
with newer technology discovered following the Sentinels War.  The hull was
lengthened by 210 feet (64 m) in order to accommodate more powerful engines
and larger hangar bays.  Two additional Alpha fighter launch bays were added
near the bow of the vessel providing the Icarus with 48 more rapid-launch
fighters than the standard Ikazuchi design.  The weaponry was also augmented
with the addition of two more dual-barrel heavy laser turrets on the top of
the vessel and two heavy missile bays on the rear of the ship.  The main laser
cannon on the bow of the ship was replaced with a newer design that provided
more power and greater range than its predecessor.  Finally, several dozen
anti-mecha cannons were distributed across the Icarus' hull to increase the
ship's defenses against Invid mecha.
<P>
The extensive modifications to the Icarus took almost 3 years to complete. 
When Colonels John Korcheck and Roger Harris receive approval for an Earth
reconnaisance mission in 2042 the Icarus was chosen as the flagship for the
mission, and subsequently the new recon force was named the <B>REF Icarus
Recon Group</B>.  The Icarus was then further modified to include enhanced
tactical and subspace sensors, as well as an improved hyperspace
communications suite.  REF engineers felt that these improvements would
greatly enhance the Icarus' role in the recon mission.  Work also began on
three more <I>Icarus</I>-class command carriers; the <I>Excelsior</I>,
<I>Endeavor</I> and <I>Defiant</I>.  Unfortunately these ships would not be
ready for the Icarus mission, but instead would be included in the Prometheus
Attack Group in 2047.
<P>

The Icarus performed well as the flagship for the Icarus Recon Fleet during
2044.  Unfortunately the mission was betrayed by an unwilling double-agent
planted among the fleet by the leader Invid Varron.  During a rescue mission
the Icarus and her escorts were ambushed by a large force of Invid, and within
minutes all ships except the Icarus had been destroyed by concentrated Invid
fire.  In a last-minute decision Col. Harris took command of the Icarus' mecha
forces and made a diversionary run for Earth, while Col. Korcheck took the
heavily-damaged Icarus out of orbit and executed a space fold back to Tirol. 
Korcheck and the Icarus managed to escape back to Tirol with reconnaissance
data from the Icarus mission that would prove invaluable to the Prometheus
Fleet's assault on Earth.  Harris and his forces managed to rendezvous with
resistance leaders on Earth, although he was later killed in action while
leading an evacuation from a compromised resistance safehouse.
<P>
Following the end of the Third Invid War Icarus-class command cruisers became
the standard cruiser design of the REF (and later the RGF) until the
introduction of the <I>Lexington SFC-7500</I> class command carriers in 2057. 
Many Icarus and Ikazuchi carriers are still in active service with the RGF
fleet and remain a common sight in the Sentinels Alliance.  Icarus carriers
were produced at the Fantoma Orbiting Shipyards, and later also at the REF
Factory Satellite.  At their height the command ships were manufactured at a 
rate of 3 per year.

<B>NOTES:</B>
<OL>
<LI>Depleting the MDC of the main body will destroy the Icarus carrier.  The
ship will be literally broken in two.  All internal systems will shut down,
including life support and internal gravity.  In addition, there is a 45%
chance that the power systems will overload and the ship will explode, doing
8D6x1,000 M.D. to everything in a 5,000 ft (1,525 m) radius.  Regardless of
whether it explodes or not, the ship itself will be an unsalvageable floating
wreck.
<LI>Destroying the command tower will instantly kill anyone on the bridge, as
well as (2D6)% of the overall crew.  Radar and primary communications will be
knocked out.  There are two auxiliary bridges in the main body of the ship
that the surviving crew can take command from.  However if the command tower
is lost then the ship will be at -5 initiative and -3 to dodge due to loss of
sensors.  Destroying all three communications arrays will have the same effect
without the loss of the bridge crew.
<LI>Depleting the MDC of the bow will knock out forward mega-laser, 8 of the
heavy missile bays, and 4 of the laser turrets.  The forward two Alpha launch
bays will also be destroyed.  Crew casualties will be heavy; (6D6)% of the
crew will be killed instantly when the forward section is destroyed.
<LI>Depleting the MDC of the engineering section will essentially destroy the
carrier.  All power systems, the main engines and the auxiliary engines will
be eliminated (see below).  Crew losses will be heavy; (8D6)% of the crew will
be instantly killed.  In addition, all internal systems will shut down due to
lack of power, including life support and internal gravity.  Finally, there is
a 50% chance that the reflex furnace will overload and explode, doing
4D6x1,000 M.D. to everything in a 5,000 ft (1,525 m) radius.
<LI>Destroying the Alpha launch bays will greatly impair the carrier's ability
to rapidly deploy mecha.  For every launch bay destroyed 24 Alphas will be
eliminated, along with their pilots and support crews.  If the main hangar
bays are lost it will be even more disasterous.  Under normal circumstances
the Icarus can launch or recover 16 mecha or small ships per turn excluding
the Alphas in their launch bays.  For every 500 points of damage the flight
deck takes reduce this number by 1.  If the flight deck reaches 0 MDC then it
is <I>destroyed</I>; no mecha can be launched or recovered, 40+(1D6x10)% of
the flight crew will be killed, and any mecha that have already been launched
will need to find another place to land (this includes the Alphas in the
launch bays).
<LI>Depleting the MDC of the main engines will force the ship to rely on its
auxiliary engines.  Depleting the MDC of the main engines AND auxiliary
engines will leave the ship adrift in space.  If in an atmosphere, the ship
will crash (destruction of the main engines will render the antigravity system
useless due to loss of power).
<LI>The Pinpoint Barriers regenerate at a rate of 1,250 MD per second (2,500
MD per melee round).  If destroyed, a barrier will completely regenerate
within four seconds (2 melee rounds).  See the <A HREF="#ppb">Pinpoint Barrier
System</A> entry for details.

<LI><A NAME="ppb"><B>DS-1 PINPOINT BARRIER DEFENSE SYSTEM:</B></A> Originally 
    developed by Dr. Emil Lang onboard the SDF-1 during the First Robotech
    War, the Pinpoint Barrier System is a standard defense system on board
    most REF starships, including the Icarus carriers.  The system
    generates four small disc-shaped force fields that can be positioned
    anywhere along the ship to deflect missiles, energy beams or projectiles.
    Each pinpoint barrier is about 200 ft (61 m) in length and can absorb up
    to 5,000 MD in damage, which then regenerates within 30 seconds (2 melee
    attacks).  The barriers can also be layered on top of each other to 
    generate a field which provides 20,000 MDC and can even deflect heavy 
    particle beams (usually).
    <P>
    The four barriers are controlled by operators in the command tower of the
    carrier.  These operators are instructed to defend (1) the command 
    tower, (2) main engines, (3) flight deck, and (4) weapons systems 
    in that order.  The operators primarily concentrate on defending 
    the ship against larger spacecraft and leave defense against mecha 
    attacking the carrier to the Veritechs and retractible weapon systems.
    <P><UL>
    <LI><B>PRIMARY PURPOSE:</B> Defense (the pinpoint barrier system cannot be
        used as a weapon)
    <LI><B>RANGE:</B> Up to 100 feet (30.5 m) from the surface of the vessel.
    <LI><B>DAMAGE CAPACITY:</B> Can sustain up to 5,000 MD per round. 
        Regenerates at a rate of 2,500 MD per melee round.
    <LI><B>RADIUS:</B> 200 ft (61 m)
    <LI><B>DEFENSIVE MOVEMENT:</B> Can move from one end of the carrier to 
        the other in less than a single round.  Trained operators can attempt 
        to block attacks up to 8 times per melee (counts as a parry) and are 
        at +7 to block.  Untrained characters can parry up to their number of 
        hand-to-hand attacks with their normal parry bonuses only.
    <LI><B>PAYLOAD:</B> Nearly inexhaustible.  Will work as long as system is 
        functional (see below) and engines are intact.  If main engines are
        destroyed, the barrier will loose power and not function.
    <LI><B>NOTE:</B> If all four barriers are grouped in a single spot they
        can deflect a heavy particle beam attack, such as the one generated 
        by Zentraedi or Robotech Master warships.  However, the beam will 
        completely destroy all four barriers and put incredible strain on the 
        pinpoint barrier system to the point where it may short out.  After 
        deflecting an energy beam, roll percentile dice on the table below to 
        determine additional effects/damage.
        <UL>

<H3>SYSTEMS OF NOTE:</H3>
<UL>
<LI><B>ANTIGRAVITY PROPULSION SYSTEM:</B> The Icarus carriers are
equipped with an anti-gravity propulsion system used for planetary landings
and liftoffs.  The system is good for vertical ascent/descent only and can
lift the ship at speeds of up to 1,320 feet (400 m) per minute.  The system
will function so long as the main engines can supply energy to it.
<LI><B>HYPERSPACE COMMUNICATIONS:</B> Icarus carriers are equipped with
hyperspace communications relays which allows faster-than-light communication
between the ships and other vessels or planetary bases.  Hyperspace
communications are still not instantaneous, however.  Audio/video
communication travels through hyperspace at a rate of about 5 seconds per
light year, so messages communicated over vast distances can still take days,
weeks, or months to arrive.  The Icarus carriers are equipped with three
separate hyperspace communications systems, allowing the carriers full
communications capabilities even if two of the three systems are destroyed.
<LI><B>LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEMS:</B> The Icarus carriers have sufficient life
support to provide breathable air and comfortable temperatures for 8,000
people for up to 15 years (air is recycled).  In an emergency the life support
system can support up to 12,000 people at one time, though living conditions
onboard will get extremely cramped at that point.  The cruiser also holds
sufficient food and water to support 8,000 people for up to 6 months.
<LI><B>LONG-RANGE LASER/SATELLITE RELAY COMMUNICATIONS:</B> The impressive 
communications array of the carrier can communicate with up to 1,000
craft simultaneously at ranges of up to 1,200 miles (1,920 km).  This range
can be boosted indefinitely by using satellites or other spacecraft to relay
communications.
<LI><B>LONG-RANGE RADAR:</B> The radar array of the Icarus carriers can 
track and identify up to 1,000 craft simultaneously.  The radar system has a 
3,000 mile/4,800 km range.
<LI><B>SPACE FOLD SYSTEM:</B> Icarus carriers are equipped with a Robotech
Research Group fold drive, capable of propelling the ship through hyperspace
at speeds up to 3.28x10^10 mps (5.25x10^10 kmps), or 1 light year per 6
minutes.  When executing a space fold the cruiser will transport any ships
within a 3 mile (4.8 km) radius with it, allowing it to transport up to about
100 smaller ships with it, if necessary.  The range of the fold drive is
theoretically unlimited except by the life expectancy of the spacecraft.
<LI><B>SUBLIGHT ENGINES:</B> As a backup to the Fold System, the cruiser
is equipped with sublight engines that can propel the ship at speeds up to
0.18 speed of light (28,800 miles/46,350 km per second) in space.  Note that
these engines are mainly intended for rapid movement inside a planetary system
and are not suited for long voyages between star systems.  In a planetary
atmosphere the carrier is limited to speeds of Mach 1 at low altitudes or Mach
2 at high altitudes due to hull stress.
<LI><B>SUBSPACE MASS SENSORS:</B> The Icarus cruisers are equipped
with subspace sensors which are based on the same principles as the
hyperspace communications array.  These sensors can essentially instantly
detect mass readings and movement of objects up to 1 AU (93 million miles)
distant from the carrier, and the readings are used both for early warning and
for navigation when travelling at sublight speeds.  Readings taken with the
subspace sensors are not very detailed (-25% penalty when trying to identify a
detected object) and cannot detect objects of less than 60,000 kg (this
includes most veritechs and Invid mecha).

<P>
<H3>MECHA COMPLEMENT:</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The landing bay can hold and support a grand total of 560 veritechs/destroids
of any type, in addition to the 192 Alpha fighters in the 8 Alpha launch bays,
as long as the mecha are smaller than 50 ft (15.2 m) and weigh less than 40
tons each.  In addition, there are 5 special berths for larger mecha up to 100
ft (30.4 m) tall and 300 tons in weight (i.e. Mac II or III).  Listed below is
the mecha complement of the <I>RSS Icarus</I> during the Icarus Recon Mission.
 Other Icarus-class carriers will have similar complements, though changes may
be made if required by the mission.
