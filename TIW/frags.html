In every war in human history there have been people who turned against their 
fellow citizens and worked for the "enemy".  The reasons for their defection 
vary, ranging from a belief in the cause or virtues of the opponent, to the 
promise of wealth or power in exchange for their services, to the simple 
desire to survive at any cost.  This is especially true in the post-apocalypse 
Earth of the Invid Wars, where "might makes right" and "survival of the 
fittest" are the laws of the land.
<P>
During the Second Invid War and the Regis' occupation of Earth, human allies 
were tolerated by the Invid but neither encouraged nor discouraged.  The Invid,
being a hive-mind society, had practically no experience with treason or greed,
and were not sure what to do about these terrans who claimed to be obedient to 
them.  Eventually in some cases human traitors and Invid worked out agreements 
with each other, exchanging information and captured resistance fighters for 
supplies and preferential treatment.  The cases of Jonathan Wolff and the lake
cities are good examples of this.  However, the Regis never put much 
faith in either the loyalty or the ability of the sympathizers, and largely 
ignored them throughout the course of the war.
<P>
The policy towards Invid sympathizers changed radically during the Third Invid 
War, thanks mostly in part to <B>Lieutenant Anton Kosmos</B>, 
formerly of the Eastern 
Block Soviet Independent State (EBSIS) and leader of the <B>Krugatch</B>
mercenary 
group.  Lt. Kosmos was one of the first people to notice a difference in the 
actions and behavior of the new Invid invaders compared to the Regis' troops of
the previous war.  Unlike that war, the Invid did not seem interested in the 
domination of the Earth, but rather were concentrating on harvesting large 
amounts of the Flower of Life.  The deployment of Invid mecha was mostly to 
defend their bases, and they only reacted to attacks by resistance fighters 
instead of actively seeking them out for extermination.  It was obvious that 
the new Invid were interested only in the Flower of Life and not the Earth 
itself, and Kosmos saw a great opportunity for himself and his forces.
<P>
Anton Kosmos approached the Invid with a proposal.  He explained that the Invid
were putting themselves in jeopardy by not taking a more active stance against 
the terran resistance forces.  By ignoring the rebellious humans instead of 
actively seeking out and exterminating them, they were just giving the humans 
more time to devise a way to defeat them once and for all.  In order to ensure 
the safety of their harvesting, the Invid would need to strike quickly and 
decisively, shattering humanity's ability to resist and thus ending the threats
to the Invid occupation.  Kosmos further argued that the best way to defeat a 
human was using another human, since only a human could fully understand human 
tendencies and strategies.  He proposed that his troops, together with Invid 
support and technology, could root out and destroy all resistance in North 
America, and unite it into one state completely loyal to the Invid and their 
goals.
<P>

 SRC="./Images/frags8.gif">
The <A HREF="./stage6invid.html">stage 6 Invid</A>
were intrigued by Kosmos' plan; elimination of the rebel 
threat would certainly increase the speed and efficiency of their harvesting 
and food shipments to New Optera.  They decided to form an alliance with 
Kosmos and the Krugatch, and ordered the forces of several hives in western 
and centralNorth America to cooperate with them fully.  Krugatch scientists 
worked together with the Invid, developing new weapons and mecha such as the 
<B>Annihilator</B> and <B>SH-AT</B> combat mecha.  
(for stats on these mecha, see the Robotech RPG supplement 
<I><B>LANCER'S ROCKERS</B></I>)  At first, the new alliance worked; Kosmos 
succeed in 
disabling or destroying several major pockets of resistance, including the 
<I>Detroit Underground</I> and the <I>VIPER-3</I> resistance base.  However, 
instead of 
pacifying the resistance, these defeats seemed only to strengthen their 
determination and resolve.  The resistance became a tougher and tougher 
opponent, and the stage 6 Invid began to be displeased with Lt. Kosmos' 
performance.  In a last-ditch effort to save his dream, Kosmos conceived and 
constructed the <B>I-K Mobile Sonic Cannon</B>, 
a monstrous mecha equipped with a new 
sonic weapon that could level cities.  However, the I-K was defeated by the 
famous freedom fighter <I>Lancer</I> and the troops of the 
<I>California Freedom League</I> 
during its first actual combat.  The Invid, now totally dissatisfied with Lt. 
Kosmos, withdrew all support for the Krugatch, which was then destroyed in 
short order by the California Freedom League.
<P>
Although Lt. Kosmos was now gone, his dark legacy continued.  While the method 
had failed, the theory behind Kosmos' actions still made sense to the stage 6 
Invid; the only way to guarantee the safety of their crucial harvest mission 
was the complete domination of the Earth.  While the orbiting ring of 
<A HREF="./spacehive.html">Invid Space Hives</A>
was being completed, the stage 6 Invid reconsidered their entire plan for 
their mission, which led to a complete reworking of their strategies, tactics, 
and mecha designs (for more details, see the essay <B>"The New Invid"</B> 
(still being written)).  Some stage 6 Invid also saw wisdom in Kosmos' words 
about human nature, <I>"the best way to defeat a human was using another 
human,"</I> and acted on that advice.
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=left WIDTH=288 HEIGHT=216 BORDER=2 VSPACE=2 HSPACE=2 
 SRC="./Images/frags3.gif">
Lt. Kosmos and his Krugatch are considered the first examples of FRAGS, a new 
breed of Invid sympathizers and human traitors.  The term <B>"frag"</B> comes 
from the phrases <I>"fragments of society"</I> or <I>"fragments of the EBSIS 
and Southern Cross"</I>, which are both good descriptions of the typical 
makeup of frag groups.  Frags are 
tough, ruthless people who have given up their freedom and sworn to serve the 
Invid in exchange for safety, supplies, and power.  They range in size from 
biker gangs of a dozen individuals to small armies of hundreds who help to 
manage the <B>Invid slave labor camps</B>.  Although most frags are criminals 
and social outcasts, a sizable percentage of them are trained soldiers from 
the EBSIS or Southern Cross who are tired of fighting the Invid and wish to 
join the (currently) winning side.  Regardless of origin, all frags are 
brutal and immoral, and usually are only interested in themselves.
<P>
Not all stage 6 Invid use frags; many believe that humanity is good only for 
slave labor or extermination.  And even those who use frags don't trust them 
completely.  When frags are recruited, the Invid implant a cybernetic 
transmitter in the base of their neck, where it attaches itself to the frag's 
spinal column.  The Invid explain that they need this transmitter in order to 
identify the frags and tell them apart from the rest of humanity, but in 
reality 
they are tracking devices that allow the Invid to keep constant track of where 
the frags are.  Most frags consider it a small price to pay for preferential 
treatment from the Invid.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>NOTE:</B>the transmitter can be extracted from a dead frag and used by a 
resistance fighter to infiltrate an Invid base, but the Invid will become 
suspicious if the 
impostor does not follow his normal procedure or go places he normally 
shouldn't.  Frags don't like impostors much either; they threaten their good 
standings with their Invid bosses.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Frags are usually used as an extension of the Invid forces in areas that don't 
warrant a full force of Invid mecha.  They are given supplies and weapons, and 
then are told to follow simple orders such as "Keep the inhabitants of this 
town peaceful.  Kill any resistance fighters or dissidents who speak out 
against the Invid."  As long as they keep the inhabitants in line, frags are 
pretty much allowed to do as they please with the town.
<P>
Another major use of frags are in Invid slave camps.  The stage 6 Invid have 
found that frags make excellent slave-masters, and are usually very creative 
in finding ways to encourage maximum efficiency from the slaves.  However, in 
a way the frags themselves are prisoners of the camps, since they are 
restricted from certain areas (like the spaceport) and are not allowed to 
leave the camps.  Frags are NEVER allowed in Invid hives of any kind; no stage 
6 Invid will ever trust a human enough to let him into a major Invid base.
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=right WIDTH=288 HEIGHT=216 BORDER=2 VSPACE=2 HSPACE=2 
 SRC="./Images/frags9.gif">
Frags usually interact with the Invid via an Invid representative (a stage 4 
or 5 Invid) or by a special Invid communicator provided by their Invid 
sponsors.  Frags NEVER meet directly with the stage 6 Invid that sponsor them; 
indeed, most frags aren't even aware of the existence of stage 6 Invid.  Frags 
don't question orders; when an Invid tells them to do something, they do it 
without question.  They know that they will continue to have power and the 
Invid's support so long 
as they do so, and to oppose their Invid overlords is asking for death.  In 
exchange for their services, the Invid provide frags with supplies, armor, 
weapons, and mecha (mostly from captured resistance bases) as well as support 
and occasional protection.  The Invid do NOT supply things like food, water, 
servants, etc.; it is up to the frags themselves to procure their own living 
supplies.

Frags are somewhat sparse in North America; the concentration of the Flower of 
Life is so great there that the Invid prefer to keep control of that section of
the Earth for themselves.  They are more common in Africa and South America, or
the wastelands of Europe and Russia, where there are few flowers to harvest and
many sectors of land to patrol.  Frags don't move around much; they know that 
not all Invid like them, and if they move around much they may find themselves 
in the territory of an unsympathetic Invid overlord.

<H2>RANDOM GENERATION OF FRAG GROUPS</H2>
<P>
Frag groups provide an interesting alternative for GMs as opponents for players
in a TIW campaign.  Characters may run across small gangs of frags on the road,
or a medium sized group holding a town hostage.  Or they may be forced to match
wits with a large group of frags AND Invid while trying to free prisoners or 
steal supplies from an Invid slave camp.
<P>
Below is a step-by-step process for creating frag groups.  It is based on the 
mercenary creation rules from <B><I>Rifts Mercenaries</I></B>, but is slightly 
different in several aspects (the Invid don't like large, well-armed groups of 
frags, and don't pay their servants anything).
<P>
<OL>
<LI><B>SIZE</B>
<P>
First, decide on a size for your frag group.  A small group of frags is 
appropriate for a chance encounter on the road, while a medium group is typical
of a town occupation force set up by the Invid.  Large frag groups are usually 
reserved for Invid slave camps or major occupied cities. <B>NOTE:</B> Invid 
will generally not allow a frag gang to grow larger than 150 members; at that 
point they become hard to control and potentially dangerous.
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>SMALL GROUP:</B> A small gang, 10-30 members.
<LI><B>MEDIUM GROUP:</B> A large gang/small mercenary force, 30-60 members.
<LI><B>LARGE GROUP:</B> A large mercenary force, 60-150 members.
</UL>
<P>
<LI><B>COMPOSITION</B>
<P>
Each member of a frag group may have a different occupation.  The 
<A HREF="./newOCCs.html#ganger"><B>Ganger OCC</B></A>
was created to provide GMs with a generic set of stats for frags, but 
they may want to customize their group by assigning different OCCs to key 
members of the frag 
group.  Roll percentile on the table below to randomly determine a frag OCC.
<P><PRE>

  posing as a frag to get a closer look at Invid installations 
  and operations.  If the PCs get into trouble while tangling 
  with frags (s)he MAY lend a hand, but his/her first priority 
  will be to remain undercover and gather information for the REF.

<P>
<LI><B>WEAPONRY</B>
<P>
The Invid provide frags with their choice of weapons captured during raids on 
resistance fighters, as well as ammo, power packs, etc.  It is up to the frags 
themselves to maintain the weapons; the Invid have no practical knowledge of 
the guns or their workings.  All they provide to the frags is access to 
captured weapon caches and ammo dumps.
<P>
First roll 1D4 to determine how many weapons each special frag has, then roll 
on the table below to determine each weapon the frag owns.  The frag will 
have 1D6 spare clips for each weapon he rolls on the table below.

<P>
<LI><B>BODY ARMOR</B>
<P>
Frags are also provided with human body armor captured from resistance 
fighters.  However, the supply of armor is lower than weapons since most captured 
body armor is destroyed when the rebel inside the armor is killed.  Due to this 
shortage not all frags get body armor.  Roll on the table below to see if the 
frag has a suit of body armor, and if so which type.
<PRE>

<P>
<LI><B>MECHA</B>
<P>
Larger groups of frags are sometimes given captured mecha to help them with 
their duties.  Frags who are given mecha are naturally watched VERY closely, 
and any suspicious behavior by the pilot will usually be countered with a 
"shoot first, ask questions later" response by the Invid.  Only Cyclones and 
small battloids are given to frags; absolutely NO functioning Veritechs or 
heavily armed mecha are provided, as the stage 6 Invid are not stupid enough 
to trust the resistance with these types of weaponry.  Also, frags will not be 
allowed to own more than 1 mecha per every 10 members or so the group has.

       mecha has been seriously damaged in the past and is now 
       permanently stuck in battloid mode.  The jet engines are ruined 
       and only 6D6 missiles remain in the MM-60.  However, the MDC 
       values are at full strength, and the mecha has a fully
