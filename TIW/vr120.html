<H1>THE VR-120 FERRET</H1>
<IMG ALIGN=right BORDER=2 SRC="./Images/ferret.gif">
<H2>BACKGROUND</H2>
The VR-120 Ferret is a new cyclone variant that places an emphasis on speed 
and agility, rather than strength and firepower like the VR-152 or VR-141.  
Smaller, lighter, and less armored than its cousins, the Ferret is capable of 
an amazing 240 mph (384 kmph) on open roads in motorcycle mode, and a 215 mph 
(344 kmph) air speed when flying in battloid.  This speed combined with the 
phenonemal agility possed by all cyclones makes the Ferret ideal for 
reconnaissance and scouting missions.  The speed does come at a price, though; 
as mentioned above, the armor on the Ferret is reduced and some armaments have 
been cut (compared to other newer Cyclone designs) to reduce the overall 
weight of the cyclone.  Usually Ferret pilots 
do not engage in direct combat with enemy forces.  Instead they use speed and 
agility to avoid detection and relay information to their command, which can 
then call in appropriate forces to deal with the threat.
<P>
The VR-120 Ferret is the smallest of the new cyclones, closely resembling the 
old VR-038-LT at first glance.  The nose is larger, however, and weapon 
systems are mounted on the front wheel hub.  The Ferret is popular with scouts 
and nomads among the resistance on Earth, who value its ability for speed and 
stealth.  Ferret Pilots usually wear the standard CVR-4 body armor.

<OL>
<LI>Depleting the M.D.C. of the Main Body will shut the mecha down 
    completely.
<LI>Depleting the M.D.C. of the body armor will destroy it and very likely 
    kill the wearer (10% chance of survival).
</OL>
The Second Generation Cyclones are equipped with laser resistant 
ceramic armor, so laser weapons do only HALF damage.  This does NOT 
include any other energy attacks such as particle beams or ion blasts, 
nor does it help against explosives.
<P>
CVR-4C Heavy Armor is incompatible with the VR-120 Ferret.

<DL>
<DT><B>Special Bonuses:</B>
<DD>The VR-120 Ferret has a <B>+1 bonus</B> to <I>initiative, parry, dodge, 
    and roll</I>, due to 
    its greater speed and agility (from lower weight) than normal Cyclones.
    This bonus is in addition to any other bonuses the pilot may possess based
    on skill or training.
<P>
<DT><B>Cargo:</B>  
<DD>The VR-120 has detachable cargo boxes that are connected to the 
rear of the bike like saddlebags.  The size of each container is 18 
inches tall by 20 inches wide by 18 inches deep.  The VR-152 can hold 200 lbs 
(84 kg) in addition to the rider. Reduce maximum speed by 20% for every 
additional 25 lbs (11 kg) over the limit and add -1 to dodge. 
<P>
Unlike its predecessors, the storage boxes of the new cyclones do NOT 
drop off when they convert to battloid mode.  Instead, the boxes are 
shifted to the lower back, just below the thruster packs and covering 
the butt of the pilot.  The passenger, however, isn't so lucky.
</DL>
<P>
<B>Main Engine:</B> FF-600 Fusion/Protoculture Engine
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Range:</B>
<DD> 2 protoculture cells will power the cyclone for approximately 12 
months before needing refueling.  The backup system can operate on 1 
protoculture cell for 6 months at no penalty.  Constant flying will 
drain the protoculture cells twice as quickly for all models.  As a 
final backup, the cyclone can run on fusion power alone for up to 400 
miles on a full tank of fuel, but maximum speed is reduced 15% and 
constant flying is impossible.  The fusion engine runs off hydrogen, so 
any hydrogen-rich liquid (like water or ammonia) can be used for fuel.  
Extra gas from the fusion engine is released through an exhaust port.
<P>
<DT><B>Color Scheme:</B>
<DD>Following the new painting scheme for most REF mecha, the VR-120 cyclones 
are colored based on where they are stationed.  Desert Cyclones are usually 
painted in a tan camouflage, Arctic Cyclones are painted a flat white, etc.  
This is especially important in the case of the Ferret, as its missions 
typically call for the mecha to remain concealed and spy on enemy forces at 
close range.  Each cyclone is streamlined in a color corresponding to the 
position of the pilot.  Enlisted Pilots have their cyclones streamlined in 
Blue, Aces and low-ranking Officers in Red, and Platoon Leaders in Green.

<H3>WEAPON SYSTEMS</H3>
<OL>
<LI><B>GR-103LT MINI-MISSILE LAUNCHER (2)</B>.  Although based on the older
  VR-038-LT Cyclone, the VR-120 Ferret was equipped with GR-103 shoulder 
  missile launchers like its newer bretheren to give it more punch.  However, 
  due to the need to keep the Ferret's weight low, the payload for the GR-103s 
  had to be halved to 3 missiles per launcher, giving a total of 6 
  mini-missiles instead of the normal payload of 12 for VR-1XX cyclones.  
  Like the standard GR-103s, the 103LTs have been updated with newer 
  technology which makes them more  
  resilient to damage and easier to repair (+20% to repair rolls).  In 
  motorcycle mode, the two missile launchers are side by side in the 
  nose of the cycle.  In battloid mode, the missile launchers are 
  divided, with one on each shoulder of the mecha.  Armor-piercing missiles 
  are typically issued to Ferrets.
  <P><UL>
  <LI><B>Primary Purpose</B>: Assault
  <LI><B>Secondary Purpose</B>: Anti-Aircraft, Anti-Mecha
  <LI><B>Missile Type</B>: Any type of REF Mini-missile EXCEPT Plasma.  
      Armor-piercing are standard-issue for the VR-120 Ferret. 
  <LI><B>Mega-Damage</B>: Varies with missile type.
  <LI><B>Rate of Fire</B>: One at a time or in volleys of two, four, or six. 
      Remember, a volley counts as one melee attack regardless of the 
      number of missiles.
  <LI><B>Range</B>: Varies with missile type; 20 ft to 1 mile.
  <LI><B>Payload</B>: 3 missiles per each launcher, for a total capacity of 6.
  </UL><P>
<LI><B>GR-187 HIP MISSILE LAUNCHERS</B> (2).  A new addition to modern
  cyclones, the VR-120 Ferret comes automatically equipped with a
  pair of GR-187s.  These weapons are mounted on the hip/upper leg
  shields in battloid mode and in the lower back of the cyclone in
  motorcycle mode.  It appears as four small tubes built directly into
  the armored plate.  The missiles can only fire in battloid mode.
  <P><UL>
  <LI><B>Primary Purpose</B>: Assault
  <LI><B>Secondary Purpose</B>: Anti-Aircraft, Anti-Mecha
  <LI><B>Missile Type</B>: Any type of REF Mini-missile EXCEPT Plasma.
      Armor-piercing are standard-issue for the VR-120 Ferret.
  <LI><B>Mega-Damage</B>: Varies with missile type.
  <LI><B>Rate of Fire</B>: One or two at a time.
  <LI><B>Range</B>: Varies with missile type; 20 ft to 1 mile.
  <LI><B>Payload</B>: 4 missiles per each launcher, for a total capacity of 8.
  </UL><P>
<LI><B>MODULAR WEAPON SYSTEMS</B>.  As with all REF Cyclones, the arm shields
  of the VR-120 Ferret are designed to interface with one of the GR-series
  weapon modules.  One weapon module can be mounted on each forearm shield, 
  and it is not necessary to mount the same modules on each shield.  The 
  Cyclone's onboard computer system will automatically recognize which weapon
  module is installed and adjust the HUD displays on the pilot's helmet 
  accordingly.  Any GR-series weapon module can be used.
  <P>
  Typical VR-120s are assigned two <A HREF="./cycloneweapons.html#gr215">
  GR-215 BEAM/LASER CANNON</A> units, or two <A 
  HREF="./cycloneweapons.html#gr220">GR-220 BEAM CANNON/SMG</A> units, though 
  different weapons may be assigned if necessary or desired.  Click <A HREF=
  "./cycloneweapons.html">HERE</A> for a complete listing of cyclone weapon
  modules.
  <P>
<LI><B>Hand-to-Hand Combat</B>.  Punch does 1D4 M.D.  Kick does 1D4 M.D. (The 
  VR-120 Ferret has an equivalent strength of PS 35)  Leap Kick 
  does 2D4 M.D.  Body Flip or Body Block does 1D4 M.D.
  <P>
<LI>Any type of hand-held weapon can be fired by the pilot while in 
  cyclone armor, including the new <A HREF="./ref-weapons.html#g1000">Gallant 
  1000 Multi-Weapon System</A>.

<LI>  <B>NIGHTVISION CAMERA:</B> A low-light amplification camera that allows the 
      pilot of the VR-120 to see clearly in normal darkness.  The camera will 
      NOT work in pitch-blackness and can be blinded by bright lights such as 
      flares or weapon discharges.  <B>Range:</B> 400 ft (120 m).
<LI>  <B>FIBER-OPTIC COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM:</B> The VR-120 is equipped with a 
      communcations system that can transmit audio and video signals to a 
      command base via fiber-optic cable laid along the ground.  The advantage 
      of this system is that it allows clear communications even in heavy 
      static or jamming situations, and that the communication signal is 
      virtually undetectable by enemy sensors.  The disadvantage is that the 
      fiber-optic cable must remain intact for the system to work.  
      <B>Range:</B> equal to the 
      length of the cable; up to 2 miles.
