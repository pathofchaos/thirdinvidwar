<P>
The <B>Gallant 1000 Multi-Weapon System</B> first began production in 2038
shortly before the beginning of the Third Invid War.  The Gallant 1000 was the
first weapon system designed by <B>Tirolian Weapons Research (TWR)</B>, a new
company recently started on Tirol by several ex-REF weapons researchers who
retired from the service and started their own production company.  Despite
accusations of favoritism from several rival production firms (most notably
the <B>Kabarran National Weapons Factory</B>), the Gallant 1000 proved to 
be an excellent weapon and quickly became the standard sidearm for the REF,
replacing the aging Gallant H-90 system.
<P>
The Gallant 1000 is an extremely durable weapon, requiring minimal maintenance
and functioning well in any type of environment.  The most notable feature of
the system remains its versatility; being able to vary power levels with the
flick of a switch.  The Gallant 1000 has 4 weapon settings, with various
ranges and damage for each setting.  All four settings can be used without the
additional rifle stock (an improvement over the original H-90), although using
setting 4 without the stock will exhaust the energy cell in only four shots. 
The Gallant itself is shaped somewhat like the original, with a
complete circular housing instead of the traditional handle design.  However,
the top of the gun nozzle is higher and completely flat to make the gun easier
to aim.  The Gallant 1000 comes with several detachable options, including a
electronic sight with computer targeting interface, a flash suppressor, and a
shoulder stock which can also hold additional e-clips.  Like the older Gallant
H-90, the Gallant 1000 can be used as a pistol, submachine gun, or a rifle
depending on what options are attached.
<P>
The success of Gallant 1000 allowed TWR to land several lucrative contracts
with the Robotech Expeditionary Force, including the design of the energy
weapon systems on the new <A HREF="./vaf8.html">VAF-8</A> and <A
HREF="./vaf9.html">VAF-9</A> veritech fighters.  The Gallant 1000 remained the
standard sidearm of the REF until 2055.  Although somewhat rare compared to
the Gallant H-90, the Gallant 1000 can still be found often on Earth, a legacy
to the violence of the Third Invid War.

<H2>GALLANT H-95 MULTI-WEAPON SYSTEM</H2></A>
<IMG SRC="./Images/gallant95.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=150>
The <B>Gallant H-95</B> was developed by Tirolian Weapons Research in response
to a request for a smaller version of the standard H-90.  Although rugged,
reliable, and versatile, the Gallant H-90 was somewhat bulky and difficult to
conceal.  This was especially inconvenient for REF mecha pilots who already
had very little space to work with in their cockpits.  The Gallant H-95 was
therefore designed with pilots in mind, packing the power and versatility of
the H-90 in a much smaller frame that could be more easily concealed in a
flight suit or in CVR-series armor.
<P>
Like the H-90, the basic design of the Gallant H-95 is circular, with the
handle being at the back and the firing mechanism curving forward around the
holder's knuckles.  However the H-95 compacts this design significantly so
that the gun resembles a "D".  This has resulted in the H-95 being given the
nickname "brass knuckles" among REF soldiers.  Because of recent advances in
power systems and accellerator barrel design TWR engineers were able to
increase the number of shots the H-95 could deliver while keeping power levels
and damage capacity about the same.  The H-95 still uses standard protoculture
cells for power; despite the risk of detection by Invid protoculture sensors,
protoculture cells still remain the most compact and efficient type of energy
cells available.
<P>
The H-95 is 100% compatible with the H-90's systems, meaning that the weapon
can use the same suppression barrel and stock that the H-90 does for increased
power and range.  The H-95 is now standard issue for all REF mecha pilots,
while the newer Gallant 1000 is reserved for ground soldiers, cyclone riders,
and others that need greater firepower.  The Gallant H-90 is no longer
manufactured, although many thousands still remain in service both on Earth
and in the REF fleet.

<H2><A NAME="parasite">MARK IX "PARASITE"</A><BR>
    RIFLE-LAUNCHED MAGNETIC CLUSTER MINE<BR>
    <SMALL>Written by <A HREF="http://members.aol.com/armymaniii">the Armyman</A> 
    (<A HREF="mailto:armymaniii@aol.com">armymaniii@aol.com</A>)</SMALL></H2>
<IMG SRC="./Images/parasite1.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="201" HEIGHT="397">
The Parasite was developed initally during the first few years after the
Malcontent Uprisings, around 2021.  Though it is unknown where the weapon
originated from, it is believed that it was first produced either by the
Merchant Republic or by state factories in the E.B.S.I.S.  Regardless, it has
become widely copied by many black marketeers, as well at least four other
major arms manufacturers in the Congo Quadrant, the former Zentraedi Control
Zone and North America.
<P>
Employed successfully by the R.D.F. and other forces against the larger
Zentraedi and their Regult combat pods, the weapon found itself shelved during
the Robotech Masters assault on Earth in the intervening years before the
coming of the Invid.  This is due in part because of the Master's tactics and
their equipment rather than any shortcoming in the weapon itself.  However,
with the resurgence of Invid activity after the assault on Reflex Point and
the Invid's new willingness to "duke-it-out" on the human's level, the
Parasite has once again found a place in the resistance's arsenal.
<P>
The Parasite is a rifle-launched munition of considerable size.  To fire, one
places a parasite over the suppression barrel of a Gallant H-90, H-95 or
Gallant 1000 laser rifle.  The <B>lowest S.D.C. setting</B> is used to ignite
the Parasite's own propulsion system and the mine leaves the barrel with
explosive force (a good, steady firing position is a must), while small
nozzles at the base of the warhead impart a stabilizing spin to the whole
projectile.  Within range of a target and using its radar proximity probe, the
mine detonates a small, core explosive that spreads up to twenty-five of the
tiny M21 submunitions in a controlled pattern.  Each submunition is highly
magnetic and will adhere to any ferro-magnetic objects within a 30 foot (9.1
m) blast radius.  Once an internal chip in the submunition detects that it is
settled (2-4 seconds after the initial blast), it activates a highly sensitive
motion sensing device that will detonate at the slightest movement (more than
.5m/second is sufficient for detonation).  Additionally, the M21's casing is
pressure sensitive meaning that it will detonate if squeezed or stepped on, so
even the munitions that fail to find a target are still dangerous.
<P>
As a separate feature, the Parasite can also be used as a area denial mine as
evidenced by the four folding legs arranged around the base propulsion module.
 In this capacity, the mine is set in position by hand and a priming pin is
pulled inside the bottom propusion module.  After the pin is pulled, the mine
has a short, fifteen second delay before it is armed and begins scanning the
area with its radar proximity probe.  Anything coming within the 20 foot (6.1
m) blast radius will activate the mine, spreading its M21 submunitions in a
circular pattern.  Targets in the blast radius will be struck by 1D6+1
submunitions.  This feature is not used often for obvious reasons:  though
most Invid will walk right up on the mine, humans and stage four (or higher)
Invid will recognize the weapon and either avoid or destroy it.
<DL>
<DT><B>Weight:</B> 24 lbs (10.9 kg)
<DT><B>Damage:</B> 
<DD>2 points of M.D. per submunition.  To determine the number of submunitions 
   that strike a target, the firer takes his attack roll (without modifiers) 
   and adds one (1).  A <I>natural 20</I> means all 25 have struck and the target 
   suffers maximum damage (50 M.D.).
<DT><B>Range:</B> 
<DD>500 ft/1150 ft (150 m/350 m), if fired from a flat or ballistic trajectory.  
    Though firing it ballistically (an arced trajectory, called "lobbing") has 
    greater range, most weapons have no provision for a special ranged sight.  
    Additionally, the extreme weight of the projectile makes firing the mine 
    difficult at best.  Regardless of the method used to aim, for every 50 
    meters beyond the initial 50 meter mark, the firer suffers a cumulative -1 
    to strike.
    <P>
    <I><B>For Example:</B> a Freedom Fighter spots an Invid Attack Scout 200 
    meters away and readies his Parasite from a concealed position.  He will 
    need at least an 8 to strike because he will suffer a penalty of -3 to 
    strike his target (50 meters [no modifier] +150 meters [-1 to strike per 
    additional 50 meters]).</I>

<H2>REF COMBAT BODY ARMOR (Old Style)</H2></A>
<IMG SRC="./Images/cba.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="144" HEIGHT="350">
The REF Combat Body Armor was the immediate predecessor to the now-legendary
CVR-3 Cyclone Body Armor.  First produced in 2021 during the final planning stages for the SDF-3 Pioneer mission, the armor provided REF personnel and foot soldiers with better protection than the standard REF flightsuits of the time.  The CBA was constructed out of new (at the time) high-strength ceramic and laminate materials that provided better protection than the RDF Heavy Combat Armor while only minimally restricting movement.  Although not quite suited for Veritech or Destroid pilots who required a wide range of motion, the armor proved excellent for crews of ground vehicle such as the AAT-30 and the MTA Titan.  The Southern Cross also adopted the CBA and used it with the <A HREF="../Garland/index.html">Garland-series transformable motorcycles</A>.  Eventually both the REF and the Southern Cross improved on the CBA's design, resulting in the CVR-3 and SC series body armors respectively.  During the Second and Third Invid Wars CBA became extremely rare on Earth, only occasionally being found in long-forgotten Southern Cross weapons caches and abandoned bases.

The CVR-3 series armor was the standard REF body armor during the Third
Robotech War/Second Invid War (2035-2038).  Developed in the early 2030s near
the end of the Sentinels War the CVR-3 was a total redesign of the outdated
and obsolete combat body armor that had served the REF since the launch of the
SDF-3 Pioneer.  The CVR-3 was a durable blend of metal alloys and ceramics
that was lighter and far stronger than earlier armors, and allowed for the
inclusion of many additional features such as an environmental control
computer, an independent oxygen supply, and a more powerful tactical radio. 
The CVR-3 became an integral part of subsequent weapon systems, most notably
the Cyclone Veritech Ride Armors.  Thousands of suits of CVR-3 armor made it
to Earth during the Second and Third Invid Wars, and the CVR-3 became a
popular symbol of the terran resistance.  Although no longer in use by the RGF
military CVR-3 armor is still very popular among police and civilian defense
forces.

<H2>REF CVR-4 BODY ARMOR</H2></A>
In 2038 the REF command approved a proposal to update the CVR-3 series body
armor with new technology.  The alliance with the sentinels races following
the First Invid War led to an exchange of technical knowlege and many new
discoveries that could be used to improve the military designs used by the
REF.  One of the most dramatic new discoveries was molecular aligned metallic
alloys taught to REF engineers by the Spherians.  MA alloys were chains of
molecules arranged in interlocking geometric patterns which eliminated
material flaws and dramatically increased alloy strength.  The procedure was
similar to how turbine blades for jet fighters were produced in the late 20th
and early 21st centuries but was far cheaper and could be manufactured on a
much greater scale.  MA alloys were used as the basis for the new CVR-4 body
armors that would replace the older CVR-3 armors currently in service.
<P>
CVR-4 body armor comes in two different versions, a standard version and a
CVR-4C heavy combat version which features increased strength at the cost of
some flexibility and agility.  CVR-3 and CVR-4 armor is interchangeable,
meaning that a CVR-4 armor will work with older VR-0XX cyclones (and CVR-3
armor will work with the VR-1XX second generation cyclones).  CVR-4C armor is
specifically designed for the <A HREF="./vr152.html">VR-152 Battler II</A> and
the <A HREF="./vr112.html">VR-112 Samson</A> and will not work with other
cyclone models.  Like CVR-3 armor, CVR-4 armor is available in separate styles
for men and women.
