<H1>THE VR-117 FIREFLY</H1>
<H2>BACKGROUND</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=right WIDTH=198 HEIGHT=302 SRC="./Images/firefly.gif">
The VR-117 Firefly Rescue Cyclone is another non-combat specialty cyclone used
as a support vehicle for the REF military.  Designed during the Cyclone
Redesign Project of 2039, the Firefly is a "light" cyclone intended for use in
medical and rescue missions.  Based loosely on the VR-120 Ferret combat
cyclone, the VR-117 is designed to be light and agile while retaining the
strength and protection that makes it ideal for rescue missions and damage
control.  The Firefly is commonly found on REF starships and bases assigned to
maintenace and damage control teams, and are commonly issued to <A
HREF="./newOCCs.html#paramedic"><B>REF Combat Paramedics</B></A> for use in
the field.
<P>
The VR-117 Firefly is somewhat similar to the VR-120 Ferret but is slightly
heavier and has heavier shielding.  In battloid mode the differences are even
greater, with the Firefly having heavy plates, search lights, and various
containers mounted on the chest and torso areas.  The super-hard materials
used in the construction of the VR-117 make it nearly impervious to damage
from fire and debris, and special chemical coatings on the armor plates
provide protection even from high-level radiation and nuclear fires.  The
Firefly has performed admirably under the worst conditions both in space and
on land, and has become a valuable addition to both military and civilian
rescue services.  The only downside to the cyclone is the high cost of the
special heat shielding the mecha uses.
<P>
Like the VR-112 Samson, the design for VR-117 Firefly became commercial
property when the design team that worked on the new generation Cyclones
retired from the REF after the Third Invid War.  The design has changed little
over the years since 2039, and is currently produced by several mecha
construction companies under liscense from <I>Samson Industries</I> based on
Tirol.  The VR-117 is now extremely common both on Earth and on Tirol, as most
fire-fighting departments own at least one of the rescue mecha.

The Second Generation Cyclones are equipped with laser resistant 
ceramic armor, so laser weapons do only HALF damage.  This does NOT 
include any other energy attacks such as particle beams or ion blasts, 
nor does it help against explosives.
<P>
CVR-4C Heavy Armor is incompatible with the VR-117 Firefly.

<DD>The VR-117 has detachable cargo boxes that are connected to the 
rear of the bike like saddlebags.  The size of each container is 18 
inches tall by 20 inches wide by 18 inches deep.  The VR-117 can hold 200 lbs 
(84 kg) in addition to the rider. Reduce maximum speed by 20% for every 
additional 25 lbs (11 kg) over the limit and add -1 to dodge. 
<P>
Unlike its predecessors, the storage boxes of the new cyclones do NOT 
drop off when they convert to battloid mode.  Instead, the boxes are 
shifted to the lower back, just below the thruster packs and covering 
the butt of the pilot.  The passenger, however, isn't so lucky.

<P>
<B>Main Engine:</B> FF-600 Fusion/Protoculture Engine
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Range:</B>
<DD> 2 protoculture cells will power the cyclone for approximately 12 
months before needing refueling.  The backup system can operate on 1 
protoculture cell for 6 months at no penalty.  Constant flying will 
drain the protoculture cells twice as quickly for all models.  As a 
final backup, the cyclone can run on fusion power alone for up to 400 
miles on a full tank of fuel, but maximum speed is reduced 15% and 
constant flying is impossible.  The fusion engine runs off hydrogen, so 
any hydrogen-rich liquid (like water or ammonia) can be used for fuel.  
Extra gas from the fusion engine is released through an exhaust port.
<P>
<DT><B>Color Scheme:</B>
<DD>The standard color scheme for the VR-117 Firefly is red, orange, and
yellow, which makes them easy to spot in disaster areas where there is lots of
rubble and smoke.  Since this color scheme does not work particularly well in
combat situations, VR-117 cyclones in the field are usually painted in a
camouflage pattern based on where they are stationed.  Desert Cyclones are
usually painted in a tan camouflage, Arctic Cyclones are painted a flat white,
etc.  The Firefly is then streamlined in light blue and orange, and is marked
with crosses and other medical symbols in an attempt to make it clear to
observers that the VR-117 is a non-combatant medical vehicle (of course the
Invid rarely take notice of this fact, unfortunately).

<H3>WEAPON SYSTEMS</H3>
<OL>
<LI><B>GR-103LT MINI-MISSILE LAUNCHER (2)</B>.  Like the VR-120 Ferret, the 
  VR-117 Firefly is equipped with a smaller version of the classic GR-103 
  shoulder missile launchers.  The payload for the GR-103LTs are 3 missiles 
  per launcher, giving a total of 6 mini-missiles in the shoulders.  Like the 
  standard GR-103s, the 103LTs have been updated with newer technology which 
  makes them more resilient to damage and easier to repair (+20% to repair 
  rolls).  In motorcycle mode, the two missile launchers are side by side in 
  the nose of the cycle.  In battloid mode, the missile launchers are divided,
  with one on each shoulder of the mecha.
  <P>
  VR-117 Fireflies stationed on REF Starships and Bases (as well as civilian 
  cyclones) are usually issued flame-retardant missiles for use fighting 
  fires.  VR-117s in the field are issued armor-piercing missiles as an anti-
  mecha defense, however.
  <P><UL>
  <LI><B>Primary Purpose</B>: Fire Suppression
  <LI><B>Secondary Purpose</B>: Anti-Mecha
  <LI><B>Missile Type</B>: Any type of REF Mini-missile EXCEPT Plasma.  
      Armor-piercing are standard-issue for the VR-117 Firefly in the field. 
  <LI><B>Mega-Damage</B>: Varies with missile type.
  <LI><B>Rate of Fire</B>: One at a time or in volleys of two, four, or six. 
      Remember, a volley counts as one melee attack regardless of the 
      number of missiles.
  <LI><B>Range</B>: Varies with missile type; 20 ft to 1 mile.
  <LI><B>Payload</B>: 3 missiles per each launcher, for a total capacity of 6.
  </UL><P>
<LI><B>GR-187 HIP MISSILE LAUNCHERS</B> (2).  A new addition to modern
  cyclones, the VR-117 Firefly comes automatically equipped with a
  pair of GR-187s.  These weapons are mounted on the hip/upper leg
  shields in battloid mode and in the lower back of the cyclone in
  motorcycle mode.  It appears as four small tubes built directly into
  the armored plate.  The missiles can only fire in battloid mode.
  <P>
  Like the GR-103LTs, the GR-187s are usually loaded with flame-retardant 
  missiles when the VR-117 is stationed on a spaceship or base.  In the field 
  however the GR-187s are usually loaded with smoke or tear gas missiles for 
  use in concealment and for identifying an LZ (landing zone).
  <P><UL>
  <LI><B>Primary Purpose</B>: Fire Suppression
  <LI><B>Secondary Purpose</B>: Miscellaneous
  <LI><B>Missile Type</B>: Any type of REF Mini-missile EXCEPT Plasma.
      Smoke/Tear Gas are standard-issue for the VR-117 Firefly in the field.
  <LI><B>Mega-Damage</B>: Varies with missile type.
  <LI><B>Rate of Fire</B>: One or two at a time.
  <LI><B>Range</B>: Varies with missile type; 20 ft to 1 mile.
  <LI><B>Payload</B>: 4 missiles per each launcher, for a total capacity of 8.
  </UL><P>
<LI><B>MODULAR WEAPON SYSTEMS</B>.  As with all REF Cyclones, the arm shields
  of the VR-117 Firefly are designed to interface with one of the GR-series
  weapon modules.  One weapon module can be mounted on each forearm shield, 
  and it is not necessary to mount the same modules on each shield.  The 
  Cyclone's onboard computer system will automatically recognize which weapon
  module is installed and adjust the HUD displays on the pilot's helmet 
  accordingly.  Any GR-series weapon module can be used.
  <P>
  Typical VR-117s are assigned two <A HREF="./cycloneweapons.html#gr117">
  GR-117 RESCUE HOOK</A> units if stationed on a base or spaceship, or one 
  GR-117 unit and one <A HREF="./cycloneweapons.html#gr220">GR-220 BEAM 
  CANNON/SMG</A> unit if in the field.  Different weapons may be substituted 
  if approved by a commanding officer.  Click <A HREF=
  "./cycloneweapons.html">HERE</A> for a complete listing of cyclone weapon
  modules.
  <P>
<LI><B>Hand-to-Hand Combat</B>.  Punch does 1D4 M.D.  Kick does 1D6 M.D. (The 
  VR-117 Firefly has an equivalent strength of PS 50)  Leap Kick 
  does 2D4 M.D.  Body Flip or Body Block does 1D4 M.D.
  <P>
<LI>Any type of hand-held weapon can be fired by the pilot while in 
  cyclone armor, including the new <A HREF="./ref-weapons.html#g1000">Gallant 
  1000 Multi-Weapon System</A>.

<LI><B>HEAVY HEAT SHIELDING:</B> The Firefly's armor is chemically treated and
    can resist heat up to 500 degrees centigrade.  Normal fires do no damage, 
    and plasma and nuclear fires do only 1/3 damage.  This armor is VERY 
    expensive, and is only standard issue on the VR-117.
<LI><B>EXTENDED OXYGEN SUPPLY:</B> Extra supplies of breathable air in the 
    armor can allow the pilot to survive up to 48 hours in a vacuum, or can be
    supplied to others through several tubes in the back of the mecha.  There 
    is also a reservoir of pure oxygen available for treating victims of smoke
    inhalation.
<LI><B>HEAT-SHIELD BLANKETS:</B> The Cyclone is equipped with two man-
    sized blankets of a remarkable material that is non-combustible and 
    resists heat up to 200 degrees centigrade.  These blankets can be used to 
    protect victims while extracting them from the fire.
<LI><B>SEARCHLIGHTS:</B> The Firefly contains two powerful searchlights 
    mounted on the front of the cyclone in motorcycle mode and on the chest in
    battloid mode.  These lights can illuminate up to 600 ft (180 m) away and 
    can penetrate light smoke and dust.  Very useful for finding victims in 
    dark places or rubble.
<LI><B>RESCUE EQUIPMENT:</B> The carrying bags of the Cyclone are always 
    filled with a variety of rescue equipment, such as extra rope, an MDC 
    crowbar, flashlights, etc.
