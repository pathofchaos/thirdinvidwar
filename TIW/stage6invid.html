<H1>THE STAGE SIX INVID NPC</H1>
<P>
<IMG WIDTH=270 HEIGHT=432 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="./Images/stage6.gif">
When the Regis decided to send an occupation force back to Earth, she 
was faced with a serious problem; it was simply impossible for her to be 
in two places at once.  Her "enlightened evolution" experiments demanded 
her full attention, but the food supply problems on New Optera were 
critical enough that she had to ensure that the temporary re-occupation 
of Earth was successful.  Plus her forces on Earth would need some way 
to rebuild all the Hives and fortifications that were destroyed during 
the Third Robotech War.  
<P>
Finally, she reached a decision.  She called together the best of the 
Stage 5 Invid that had survived the previous war with the humans.  These 
Invid were the strongest, smartest, and most loyal followers of the 
Regis, who had proven themselves time and time again on the battlefields 
of Earth.  These humanoid Invid would be the leaders of the Earth re-
occupation forces, and to this end the Regis evolved them into a higher 
form of life, granting each of them a small amount of her powers.  These 
elite Invid became the ultimate stage in Invid evolution; the Stage Six 
Invid.
<P>
The stage six Invid is completely humanoid in appearance, like the stage 
5 Invid, but are usually taller and slightly more agile.  The biggest 
difference is their eyes, which are slitted and catlike.  They are 
always very attractive and have the same light Caucasian skin/complexion 
and long hair as their less-developed brethren.  
<P>
But the greatest difference in these new Invid is the presence of 
psychic powers, similar to those of the Regis herself.  In essence, the 
stage six Invid can be considered mini-Regents and mini-Regis of the 
Invid race.  Individually, their powers are not incredibly impressive, 
but together they can perform acts equal to those of the Regis, 
including transmutation of Invid and mecha, and the alchemical ability 
to create Invid hives and power cores.  These new Invid were also the 
most intelligent and the most devious since the Regent.  They were the 
ones who came up with the idea of the Invid space hives and the new 
Invid mecha designs.  And they are constantly at work thinking up new 
plans to prevent the humans from interfering in their work.
<P>
Unfortunately, the evolution of the Stage Six Invid has had some 
unexpected effects on their mental stability.  Most of the new Invid 
consider themselves far superior to lower stage Invid, especially the 
Stage Five Invid.  This has led to a great deal of friction between the 
two Invid "races", to the point where some stage 5 Invid might consider 
betraying their superiors if they thought they could get away with it.  
This superiority complex borders on psychosis when it comes to humans.  
At best, stage 6 Invid consider humans a lesser race, who do not deserve 
the rights of freedom or self-rule.  At worst, some stage 6 Invid see 
humans as vermin, suitable only for hard labor, laboratory tests, and 
extermination.
<P>
Stage 6 Invid are ALWAYS snobbish and overbearing.  They care little for 
the concerns of others, and are often inconsiderate and outright rude to 
anyone who is not a fellow stage 6 Invid.  They are loyal only to 
themselves, other stage 6 Invid, and the Regis.  Temperament among 
leader Invid tends to vary; some are quite emotional, easily giving into 
bloodlust and berserker tendencies during battle, while others are 
analytical and emotionless, carrying out their plans and attacks with 
cold, calculated efficiency.  However, no stage 6 Invid will ever allow 
his/her emotions to interfere with the occupation force mission. 
<P>
<B>NOTE</B>: There are maybe only two dozen stage 6 Invid on Earth, including 
those stationed in the orbital hives.  Gamemasters should not 
indiscriminately throw them at PCs, but instead save these characters 
for recurring villains and enemy masterminds.  Combat with stage 6 Invid 
should only come after a long series of other adventures and battles, 
perhaps even saved for the final climactic battle of a multi-part 
adventure.

<H3>PSIONIC ABILITIES</H3>
<UL>
<LI><B>TELEPATHIC/EMPATHIC COMMUNICATION WITH INVID:</B> Stage 6 Invid have 
  full telepathic/empathic powers with all Invid.  This power does not include 
  reading minds or mental probes.  Range is about 5 miles without 
  assistance.  I.S.P. 1 per 5 minutes of communication.
<P>
<LI><B>EMPATHIC COMMUNICATION WITH NON-INVID:</B> Stage 6 Invid can sense the 
  presence and emotional state of non-Invid beings, but not as reliably as 
  with true Invid.  Empathic range is only around 100 feet.  I.S.P. 5 per 
  1 minute of communication.
<P>
<LI><B>PRESENCE SENSE:</B> Leader Invid can sense the presence of intelligent 
  life forms around them.  This sense is not exact; only direction and 
  relative distance can be detected.  It is this "sixth sense" that is 
  responsible for the stage 6 Invid's high initiative bonuses.  I.S.P.  None; 
  a natural function that requires no effort on the Invid's part.
<P>
<LI><B>SENSE PROTOCULTURE ENERGY:</B> Stage 6 Invid can psychically feel the 
  presence of protoculture energy being used anywhere near them (within a 
  1 mile range).  They can also detect the presence of living Flowers of 
  Life within 1/2 mile.  Exact number and location of protoculture sources 
  can only be detected within about 300 feet.  I.S.P.  None; a natural 
  function that requires no effort on the Invid's part.
<P>
<LI><B>LEVITATION (SELF):</B>The leader Invid can lift and suspend themselves 
  into the air.  Limited to up and down movement only.  I.S.P. 2 per minute of 
  levitation.
<P>
<LI><B>BIO-REGENERATION (SELF):</B> Stage 6 Invid can regenerate 2D6 hit 
  points, or 3D6 physical SDC points per melee.  This power does not include 
  the regeneration of lost limbs.  I.S.P. 6 per healing.
<P>
<LI><B>BIO-REGENERATION (OTHER INVID):</B> Stage 6 Invid can restore 1D8 hit 
  points, or 2D6 physical SDC points per melee to other Invid.  They must 
  physically touch the wounded Invid in order to heal them.  I.S.P. 6 per 
  healing.
<P>
<LI><B>MIND BLOCK (SELF):</B> Leader Invid can erect a mental wall that 
  prevents the penetration of telepathy, empathy, and other mind probes.  
  I.S.P. 4 per 10 minute duration.
<P>
<LI><B>PSI-SWORD:</B>The most powerful mental ability of the Stage 6 Invid is 
  the ability to form a mega-damage energy weapon from their own mental 
  powers.  This weapon appears to be  a shimmering blade of energy that 
  looks almost like a glowing sword.  The Invid can form and dissipate the 
  psi-sword at will.  The blade can do up to 1D6 M.D. to anything it 
  touches, but damage can be lessened if the Invid desires.  I.S.P. 20 per 
  5 minutes.
</UL>
<P>
<H3>SPECIAL ABILITIES</H3>
  When the Regis created the stage 6 Invid, she imparted each of them with 
  a small percentage of her powers.  Individually, these powers don't 
  amount to much, providing the leader Invid with a few low-key psychic 
  abilities.  However, when multiple stage 6 Invid work together, they are 
  capable of transmutation feats equal to those of the Regis herself.  
  These powers allowed the Invid occupation force to rebuild their 
  fortifications upon their return to Earth, and for the stage 6 Invid to 
  create the new mecha designs and orbiting hives later on during the war.
<P>
  By gathering together and combining their powers, the stage 6 Invid are 
  able to perform the following feats.  Each leader Invid can only 
  participate in one such transmutation per day.  All powers are identical 
  to those described for the Regis on pages 75-76 of the Invid Invasion 
  book.
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Transmutation of Invids:</B> Requires 6 Leader Invids.
<LI><B>Transmutation of Mecha:</B> Requires 4 Leader Invids.
<LI><B>Transmutation of Power Core (for Hive):</B> Requires 12 Leader Invids.
<LI><B>Transmutation to Warp Speed:</B> Requires 24 Leader Invids.
<LI><B>Stasis Bubble:</B> Requires 2 Leader Invids.
</UL>
<P>
  Some stage 6 Invid have been able to augment their powers for short 
  periods of time using other means, such as special Invid brain computers 
  and genesis pits.  These plot devices and their effects are left up to 
  the imagination of the game master.
