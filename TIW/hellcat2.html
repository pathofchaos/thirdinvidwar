<H1>THE HELLCAT MARK II</H1>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<IMG WIDTH=366 HEIGHT=432 SRC="./Images/hellcat2.gif">
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H2>BACKGROUND</H2>
The original Hellcat (a.k.a. Cougar) inorganic was probably the most
successful robotic design of the Invid Regent.  The inorganic was inspired by
a predatory feline the Regent observed on Praxis after conquering the world
prior to the arrival of the REF and the First Invid War.  Once the Praxian cat
had detected the scent of its prey, it would follow the scent relentlessly for
hours or even days, eventually attacking the startled target when it least
expected it.  Impressed, the Regent designed a similar robot that could sense
and track both protoculture emissions and trails left behind by humanoid life
forms and then follow them back to their source.  Fast, silent, and deadly,
the hellcat was the perfect scout/exterminator mecha, and was widely
distributed on all worlds under control of the Regent.  However, the Hellcat
was unarmed and lightly armored, which were great liabilities when facing
armored or mecha-sized opponents.  Although the Hellcat's claws could carve
through the hardest of metals, the inorganic first had to approach the mecha
and was usually cut down by defensive fire long before it could engage in
melee combat.  Usually the only time Hellcats ever won against organized REF
forces were when they were encountered in superior numbers and could overwhelm
their opponents.
<P>
Although most of the original Hellcats were destroyed when the Invid Regent
was defeated at the end of the First Invid War, the original concept of the
inorganic impressed some of the <A HREF="./stage6invid.html">Stage 6 Invid</A>
on Earth.  Several leader Invid tried to improve on the design themselves,
since an independent mecha design that could track resistance fighters back to
their bases was an ideal weapon to use against human rebels that hid in the
many ruined cities and bases of Earth.  They initially started with an
in-depth study of fast open-land Earth mammals such as cheetahs, antelopes,
and pronghorns, which led to radical redesigns of the old Hellcat design,
especially in the feet and head area.  The resulting inorganic is a synthesis
of the best observed traits of both Earth and Praxian predatory mammals.
<P>
The feet of the Hellcat Mark II are specially designed to provide the robot
with superb speed, traction, and shock absorption characteristics.  The basic
foot is a cloven hoof surrounded by four hook-shaped claws (two front, two
back) for gripping and breaking.  When not in use the claws retract upward
into the feet so that they do not interfere with running or climbing, but when
needed for extra traction or gripping they can be instantly deployed.  All of
the claws have built-in vibro blades which allow them to slice through steel
and high-tech alloys.
<P>
The head of the Hellcat has also been extensively redesigned.  The most
notable facial feature of the new inorganic is the large black eyes that curve
around the head almost to the neck.  The eyes provide both excellent
stereoscopic vision for precision tracking and aiming, as well as
near-360-degree vision making it extremely difficult to sneak up and surprise
the Hellcat.  The eyes of the Hellcat can see both the infrared and
ultraviolet spectrum, allowing it to see heat emissions and colors outside of
normal human vision.  In addition its eyes, the Hellcat also has multiple
sensors that provide it with highly detailed senses of hearing and smell. 
Finally, the Hellcat has an echo-location system which allows it to use sound
waves to determine its surroundings, similar to sonar.  With this system the
Hellcat can see in total blackness, sense movement, and even locate hidden
doors and passages.
<P>
The Hellcat Mk. II design does not have the mouth or fangs of the older
Hellcat.  Instead, the head of the mecha is equipped with two vibro-blade
tusks that are constructed out of super-hard materials.  In addition, the
Hellcat 2 has two blaster cannons mounted on extendible arms providing it with
a long-distance attack.  The arms the cannon are mounted on can pivot and
rotate in any direction, allowing the Hellcat to fire to either side or
directly behind itself.  When not in use these cannons are folded away in
compartment on either side of the torso, near the shoulder blades.  The
Hellcat's advanced sensors combined with the cannons wide range of motion
makes the inorganic <I>deadly</I> accurate in a firefight.
<P>
The overall structure of the Hellcat 2 gives it a very thin, almost
emancipated appearance, somewhat resembling a skeleton of one of the great
predatory cats of Africa.  The large black eyes, tusks, and claws give the
inorganic a devastating psychological impression, and resistance fighters who
have survived being stalked by these creatures report having nightmares about
them even months after their encounter.  The new Hellcats are usually released
in packs of 5 initially into the countryside, although they may split up and
operate solo, or combine with other Hellcat groups to form larger packs during
their travels.  The Hellcat Mk. II was initially developed and released in
central Africa, though it quickly spread to the jungles of Asia and South
America, as well as the forests and plains of North America.  Designed to
operate independently for years, the Hellcats continued to plague resistance
fighters throughout the latter half of the Third Invid War, and even for
decades after the war ended.  The last known Hellcat Mk. II was hunted down
and destroyed in 2049 in the Rocky Mountains of North America, but it is
unknown if more are lurking in the wastelands and jungles of post-Invid Earth.

<LI> Destroying the head will knock out all major sensor systems of the 
     inorganic.  The creature will thrash about blindly and wildly for 2D6 
     rounds before suffering major system failures and "dying".
<LI> Destroying the main body will completely destroy the Inorganic.  The
     smoking remains will fall to the ground and crumble into scrap metal.

<LI><B>BLASTER CANNONS (2):</B>  The main offensive weapons of the Hellcat are

    a pair of cannons mounted on extendable arms on the shoulders of the 
    inorganic.  These cannons can pivot to fire in any direction around the 
    mecha.  The Hellcat's advanced sensors make it extremely accurate when 
    firing its blasters.

        the laser can be fired in a continuous stream for cutting/demolition 
        if necessary (3D6x10 M.D. per round).
    <LI><B>Rate of Fire</B>: Five attacks per cannon, per melee.  Both cannons

        can be fired simultaneously at the same target; counts as one attack. 

        The cannons can also be fired in a full melee continuous beam, but 
        suffer a -4 to strike a moving target.

<LI><B>HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT:</B>  The Hellcat is of course well-designed to 
    engage in hand-to-hand combat, even against armored and mecha-sized 
    opponents.  In combat the Hellcat will try and rush its target and use its

    vibro-claws to tear the target to pieces.  If attacking a mecha, the 
    Hellcat will try to claw its way into the cockpit and kill the pilot.
