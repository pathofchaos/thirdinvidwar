<H1>THE VR-135 FORAGER</H1>
<IMG ALIGN=right SRC="./Images/forager.gif">
<H2>BACKGROUND</H2>
The VR-135 Forager was designed specifically as a survival mecha for crashed 
mecha pilots.  It is one of the most durable and maintenance-free mecha ever 
designed, requiring little in the way of ammo or supplies.  The internal 
systems of the Cyclone are also extremely simple in design, with instructions 
often stenciled right on the parts themselves.  Skilled bio-maintenance 
engineers have actually disassembled and reassembled VR-135s in mere minutes.
Many Foragers made it to Earth via the Icarus Recon Mission, and some clever 
bio-maintenance engineers started adapting VR-135s to their own purposes, 
producing several "home-brew" designs.  Some of the stories of what the 
Foragers could be modified to do border on the unbelievable to this day.  All 
REF mecha are now equipped with at least one VR-135 for the pilot in the 
event of a crash landing.
<P>
The VR-135 Forager is boxy in appearance, like the VR-152, but is smaller and 
less bulky.  The cyclone has a very "utilitarian" look to it, being designed 
expressly for the survival of the pilot and little else.  Despite its smaller 
appearance, the VR-135 is perhaps the most durable of all the new cyclones.  
Forager Pilots usually have the standard CVR-4 body armor, since it is the 
standard armor of mecha pilots.

<OL>
<LI>Depleting the M.D.C. of the Main Body will shut the mecha down 
    completely.
<LI>Depleting the M.D.C. of the body armor will destroy it and very likely 
    kill the wearer (10% chance of survival).
</OL>
The Second Generation Cyclones are equipped with laser resistant 
ceramic armor, so laser weapons do only HALF damage.  This does NOT 
include any other energy attacks such as particle beams or ion blasts, 
nor does it help against explosives.
<P>
CVR-4C Heavy Armor is incompatible with the VR-135 Forager.

<DL>
<DT><B>Cargo:</B>  
<DD>The VR-135 has detachable cargo boxes that are connected to the 
rear of the bike like saddlebags.  The size of each container is 18 
inches tall by 20 inches wide by 18 inches deep.  In addition, the VR-135
has four concealed pouches on the sides of the mecha, in the thigh armor
plates (where the GR-187 is located on other Cyclones).  These pouches are
each 6 inches long by 4 inches wide by 2 inches deep, and are usually used
to hold items like medical kits, tools, or extra ammo clips.  A passenger 
can also ride seated behind the driver.  The VR-135 can hold 250 lbs (110 kg) 
in addition to the rider.  Reduce maximum speed by 20% for every additional 
50 lbs (22 kg) over the limit and add -1 to dodge.
<P>
Unlike its predecessors, the storage boxes of the new cyclones do NOT 
drop off when they convert to battloid mode.  Instead, the boxes are 
shifted to the lower back, just below the thruster packs and covering 
the butt of the pilot.  The passenger, however, isn't so lucky.  The thigh
pouches are a physical part of the cyclone and do not disconnect.  They are
fully protected by the cyclone's thigh armor.
</DL>
<P>
<B>Main Engine:</B> FF-600 Fusion/Protoculture Engine
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Range:</B>
<DD> 2 protoculture cells will power the cyclone for approximately 12 
months before needing refueling.  The backup system can operate on 1 
protoculture cell for 6 months at no penalty.  Constant flying will 
drain the protoculture cells twice as quickly for all models.  As a 
final backup, the cyclone can run on fusion power alone for up to 400 
miles on a full tank of fuel, but maximum speed is reduced 15% and 
constant flying is impossible.  The fusion engine runs off hydrogen, so 
any hydrogen-rich liquid (like water or ammonia) can be used for fuel.  
Extra gas from the fusion engine is released through an exhaust port.
<P>
<DT><B>Color Scheme:</B>
<DD>Normally REF mecha are painted in camouflage schemes that match the 
location where they are stationed.  However, due to the nature of the 
Forager's purpose it is hard to predict exactly where the cyclone will 
be used.  Most Foragers are painted in a dull tan/brown color scheme 
(similar to desert mecha), but some mecha pilots take it on themselves
to customize their syrvival cyclones to their tastes.  As usual, 
each cyclone is streamlined in a color corresponding to the 
position of the pilot.  Enlisted Pilots have their cyclones streamlined 
in Blue, Aces and low-ranking Officers in Red, and Platoon Leaders in 
Green.

<H3>WEAPON SYSTEMS</H3>
<OL>
<LI><B>GR-103 MINI-MISSILE LAUNCHER (2)</B>.  The main weapon of older 
  cyclones has remained mostly unchanged in the newer models.  The launchers 
  have been updated with newer technology which makes them more  
  resilient to damage and easier to repair (+20% to repair rolls).  In 
  motorcycle mode, the two missile launchers are side by side in the 
  nose of the cycle.  In battloid mode, the missile launchers are 
  divided, with one on each shoulder of the mecha.  Both launchers hold 
  6 mini-missiles (usually armor-piercing).
  <P><UL>
  <LI><B>Primary Purpose</B>: Assault
  <LI><B>Secondary Purpose</B>: Anti-Aircraft, Anti-Mecha
  <LI><B>Missile Type</B>: Any type of REF Mini-missile EXCEPT Plasma.  
      High-explosive are standard-issue for the VR-135 Battler II. 
  <LI><B>Mega-Damage</B>: Varies with missile type.
  <LI><B>Rate of Fire</B>: One at a time or in volleys of two, four, six, or 
      all.  Remember, a volley counts as one melee attack regardless of the 
      number of missiles.
  <LI><B>Range</B>: Varies with missile type; 20 ft to 1 mile.
  <LI><B>Payload</B>: 6 missiles per each launcher, for a total capacity of 12.
  </UL><P>

<LI><B>MODULAR WEAPON SYSTEMS</B>.  As with all REF Cyclones, the arm shields
  of the VR-135 Forager are designed to interface with one of the GR-series
  weapon modules.  One weapon module can be mounted on each forearm shield, 
  and it is not necessary to mount the same modules on each shield.  The 
  Cyclone's onboard computer system will automatically recognize which weapon
  module is installed and adjust the HUD displays on the pilot's helmet 
  accordingly.  Any GR-series weapon module can be used.
  <P>
  Typical VR-135s are assigned two <A HREF="./cycloneweapons.html#gr215">
  GR-215 MISSILE LAUNCHER/BEAM CANNON</A> units, though different weapons
  may be assigned if necessary or desired.  Click <A HREF=
  "./cycloneweapons.html">HERE</A> for a complete listing of cyclone weapon
  modules.
  <P>
<LI><B>Hand-to-Hand Combat</B>.  Punch does 1D4 M.D.  Kick does 1D4 M.D. (The 
  VR-135 Forager has an equivalent strength of PS 50)  Leap Kick 
  does 2D4 M.D.  Body Flip or Body Block does 1D4 M.D.
  <P>
<LI>Any type of hand-held weapon can be fired by the pilot while in 
  cyclone armor, including the new <A HREF="./ref-weapons.html#g1000">Gallant 
  1000 Multi-Weapon System</A>.  
  <P>
<LI>Any other cyclone weapon pod can be substituted for the GR-215, both 
  from the newer cyclone models and the older ones.
</OL>

<B>STANDARD SENSORS AND EQUIPMENT FOR ALL MILITARY CYCLONES</B>
<UL>
<LI><B>LASER-RESISTANT CERAMIC COATING:</B> 1/2 damage from laser attacks.
<LI><B>ENHANCED RADAR WITH HEADS-UP DISPLAY:</B> Range: 10 miles.  Can identify 
    and track up to 40 different targets.
<LI><B>TARGETING COMPUTER:</B> Uses helmet display instead of retractable sensor 
    of older models.  Provides the pilot with +3 to strike with missiles and 
    +2 to strike with other weapon systems (Beam Cannons, Lasers, etc.).  
    <B>Range:</B> 4000 ft (609 m).
<LI><B>RADIO COMMUNICATIONS:</B> Boosts standard radio in CVR-series armors to 
    10 mile (16 km) range.   
<LI><B>MISCELLANEOUS INDICATORS:</B> Altitude, Speed, Power status, Time, Date, 
      Direction, etc.  All controlled by on-board computer.
