NEW CHARACTER SKILLS</H1>
<P>
The following is a list of new skills for the Palladium RPG system that are
being introduces with TIW.  All new skills listed below can be included under
one of the older skill categories used in the Robotech and Sentinels
role-playing games (as well as any other Palladium RPG).  The skill category
is listed in <I>italics</I> immediately after the skill name.  No conversion
of characters is necessary before they can learn any of the skills below; any
character that can learn skills from the appropriate category can learn these
new skills.  Any O.C.C. bonuses applicable are also valid for these skills.

<UL>
<LI><A NAME="basicconstruction">
<B>BASIC CONSTRUCTION <I>(Technical)</I></B></A> - The practiced skill of
repairing structures (including bridges, houses, skyscrapers, the Statue of
Liberty, etc.) or building them, under competent supervision (this would be
the skill belonging to most of today's construction
workers--non-college-trained, blue collar laborers).  This includes the
ability to read simple blueprints and the ability to operate simple
construction equipment (such as small welders, solderers, power drills, etc.).
 People who have this proficiency understand how buildings are constructed.
This can be useful in the case of rescuers trying to dig people out from under
a collapsed building (i.e. figure out how to shift it so the whole thing won't
collapse on the people).  <B>BASE SKILL:</B> 50% + 5% per level of experience.
<P>
<LI><A NAME="basicdrafting">
<B>BASIC DRAFTING <I>(Technical)</I></B></A> - Includes reading and drawing
simple blueprints, as well as making fairly good-quality drawings (Basic
Mathematics required).  <B>BASE SKILL:</B> 50% + 5% per level.
<P>
<LI><A NAME="constructiondemolitions">
<B>CONSTRUCTION DEMOLITIONS <I>(Technical)</I></B></A> - This is the same as
the Technical Demolitions skill; however only civilian (construction)
applications are taught.  When working under military conditions, or with a
military application of the skill, subtract 30%.  NOTE: An exception to this
is the Military Construction Engineer, who specializes in this kind of work. 
<B>BASE SKILL:</B> 60% + 5% per level of experience.
<P>
<LI><A NAME="constructionengineering">
<B>CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING <I>(Mechanical)</I></B></A> - The expert skill of
repairing or building structures and/or supervising Basic Construction workers
in building structures (also includes the ability to read complex blueprints
and a working knowledge of Demolitions as pertains to construction; Basic and
Advanced Mathematics required).  <B>BASE SKILL:</B> 40% + 5% per level of
experience.
<P>
<LI><A NAME="designengineering">
<B>DESIGN ENGINEERING <I>(Mechanical)</I></B></A> - The expert skill of
understanding blueprints and graphic design (also includes knowledge of how to
use CAD (Computer-Aided Design) programs).  The Design Engineer can create
complex blueprints and designs, and also make professional-quality perspective
drawings.  In addition to designing structures, Design Engineers may also
design weapons, vehicles, mecha, or other devices, depending on what their
other specialties (other skills) are (Basic and Advanced Mathematics
required).  <B>BASE SKILL:</B> 40% + 5% per level of experience.
<P>
<LI><A NAME="fieldsurgery">
<B>FIELD SURGERY <I>(Medical)</I> (Original skill by Pat Nowak)</B></A> - This
skill reflects training in emergency life-saving surgical procedures that can
be performed in the field to keep critically wounded patients alive.  Given
the proper tools, the surgeon character can perform amputations, suture torn
arteries, check internal bleeding, cauterize wounds, give blood transfusions,
etc.  (The character can also try to improvise the supplies he/she needs, but
in this case receives a -10% penalty to the skill roll.)  Field expedient
surgery is a dangerous proposition that too often results in the death of the
patient.  Because of the risk involved, field surgery is attempted only when
it is the only chance the wounded person has for survival.  If the operation
is successful, the patient lives and can be evacuated to a base or hospital,
but a failed roll results in the immediate death of the patient.  <B>BASE
SKILL:</B> 16% + 4% per level of experience.
<P>
<B>Optional Guidelines for Fatal Injury Treatment:</B> In the violent world of
the Third Invid War, unarmored humans are at an extreme disadvantage.  Once a
person's mecha and body armor are destroyed, a single M.D. blast will usually
obliterate him/her.  These guidelines are provided to give characters a
chance, however slight, to survive a blast that would normally evaporate the
character.  If the GM agrees, the character can survive a mega-damage
intensity wound if a trained medic makes a successful <I>field surgery</I>
skill roll.
<P>
Unless the attacker made a called shot or rolled an unmodified 19 or higher,
the character has the chance to live.  The basic idea is that the M.D. blast
was partially absorbed by nearby cover or merely sheared off a limb (GMs, use
your imagination).  Within 1D4 melee rounds after the character's being hit, a
medic character must attend to his/her injuries.  If the medic makes a
successful skill roll, the character is incapacitated but survives the attack,
though just barely (reduce S.D.C. to zero and hit points are at 1D6 above
zero).  A failed roll means the injured character was beyond saving and dies
an instant later.
<P>
Note that even if the surgery is successful and the victim survives, he/she is
by no means out of danger.  The person will be in shock, crippled, and will
most likely require additional extensive surgery and a long recovery period
before s/he is able to adventure again, both of which are nearly impossible to
find in the post-holocaust world of TIW.  Just keeping the character alive and
transporting him/her to adequate medical help may be an entire adventure in
itself.  Even afterwards, the character may have lasting side-effects such as
insanity or pemanenet physical crippling/disfigurement (GM's option).
<P>
<I>(This skill originally appeared in <B>Rifts World Book 11: Coalition War
Campaign</B>)</I>
<P>
<LI><A NAME="operateconstructionequipment">
<B>OPERATE CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT <I>(Pilot)</I></B></A> - The ability to
drive bulldozers, backhoes, forklifts, cranes, et cetera.  Could be considered
a Piloting skill.  <B>BASE SKILL:</B> 60% + 5% per level of experience.
<P>
<LI><A NAME="operateheavypowertools">
<B>OPERATE HEAVY POWER TOOLS <I>(Technical)</I></B></A> - Knowledge of exactly
how to use heavy equipment such as jackhammers, riveters, welders, pneumatic
drills, cutting torches, et cetera.  May also be considered a "weapon
proficiency," as it gives a +3 to strike the target with these construction
implements.  <B>BASE SKILL:</B> 55% + 5% per level of experience.
<P>
<LI><A NAME="plumbing">
<B>PLUMBING <I>(Technical)</I></B></A> - The practice of fixing leaky pipes or
hydraulics.  May be used to work on mecha hydraulic systems at -30%.  <B>BASE
SKILL:</B> 50% + 5% per level of experience.
<P>
<LI><A NAME="surveying">
<B>SURVEYING <I>(Technical)</I></B></A> - The ability to use surveying
equipment to take accurate sightings and measurements of land, for use in
architectural designs or mapmaking.  Basic and Advanced Mathematics are
prerequisites.  Adds a +10% bonus to Navigation, and a +5% bonus to Optic
Systems.  <B>BASE SKILL:</B> 40% + 5% per level.
