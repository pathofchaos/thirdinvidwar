<H2>Player's Introduction<BR>
<I>"Welcome to the End of the World"</I></H2>
</CENTER>
<P>
It is a wet, rainy February evening as you and your fellow resistance fighters
huddle together for warmth around a small fire located in some godforsaken
part of North America.  The year is 2045, for anyone who's still keeping
count, and the planet Earth is about to begin it's 10th year of occupation by
the Invid.  The cold, dark evening reflects your mood as you sit and slowly
drink your dirty rainwater, and inevitably your mind starts to review the
events of the last decade as you wonder how the war could have possibly gotten
this bad...
<P>
Things weren't always so hopeless.  In fact, back in 2038 it looked like
humanity had triumphed against impossible odds and had kicked the Invid Regis
off Earth forever.  You and a couple of your friends were actually there in
the famous <B>Battle of Reflex Point</B>, fighting alongside the troops of the
REF Jupiter Fleet, attempting to penetrate Reflex Point, the central Invid
hive itself.  The "final" battle was particularly fierce, and many of your
friends lost their lives that day.  But then at the height of the conflict,
when it looked like the tide of battle would turn against humanity yet again,
a miracle occurred.  A fiery phoenix, brighter than the sun, burst out of
Reflex Point and flew into the night sky.  The image of the bird was so
brilliant that it lit up the entire hemisphere, and all over the world people
claimed they could feel a shudder run through them as the apparition left the
Earth.  And when the phoenix had vanished, so had the Invid.  All those
scouts, troopers, pincers, and battloids were simply gone.  The only remaining
evidence that the Invid had even occupied Earth at all were some abandoned and
empty hives that were rapidly crumbling into dust.  Of course, almost the
entire Jupiter Attack Group had been wiped out as well, but it looked like
humanity had won.  After three brutal years, Earth was finally free.  Or so it
seemed.
<P>
Rumors flew as to what exactly had happened that day.  Some people said that
Lt. Scott Bernard and his freedom fighters had actually managed to get into
the Regis' central chambers somehow, and actually <I>convinced</I> the Invid
Queen to leave Earth peacefully.  Others said that a crack team of REF
Commandos flying modified VAF-7A Shadow Fighters had penetrated the hive and
killed the Regis, and that the phoenix image was actually an aftereffect of
her death.  You didn't give the matter much thought, however, and gladly took
part in the victory celebration that went on for almost a week.  After things
calmed down you said good-bye to your companions, mounted your Cyclone, and
returned to the village that you considered home.  You were given a hero's
welcome upon your arrival.
<P>
After that life seemed to return to normal.  You worked together with the men
and women of your village to rebuild and repair the damage from the war, and
slowly the wounds and scars of many battles began to fade.  You routinely took
trips to other villages in your area to trade goods, and heard many success
stories during your travels about how the world was finally getting back on
its feet.  The surviving ships and troops from the REF Jupiter Fleet were
helping to repair cities and re-establish global communications, and there
were rumors of a conference scheduled for next year in New York City to try
and form a new world government.  You didn't much care about that, however;
you were perfectly happy with your little corner of paradise.
<P>
But fate wasn't that kind.  One sunny summer morning several months later, the
daily news reports broadcast by the orbiting REF starships to villages all
over the world suddenly stopped without warning.  In addition, the land-line
communications that had been established with major cities miles away went
dead for no apparent reason.  You and your fellow townspeople could find no
explanation, when one person's random channel searching in the lower bands
finally turned up a signal.  And the words that came out of the small radio
speaker that day instantly chilled your soul...
<P>
<I>
"...it was found on the margins of a farm in the area. We observed it for an
hour or so, before it was done with whatever it was doing and took off. When
we inspected the area where it'd been, we found Flowers of Life had somehow
sprouted there. They were about a couple weeks old." 
</I><P><I>
"You mean you saw an Invid Shock Trooper in the area?" 
</I><P><I>
"Affirmative. God help us..." 
</I>
<P>

Several minutes later a blood-curdling scream from outside the building shook
you out of your state of shock.  Running out of the town hall, you immediately
realized what was causing the townspeople to run away in terror; flights of
Invid Scouts and Troopers flew in formation overhead, seemingly oblivious to
the town below them.  Fortunately your Cyclone was stored elsewhere and not
generating protoculture energy, or you would have probably been killed that
day.  Several other towns in the area tried to attack the invid, and were
wiped out in minutes.  Without warning, the Invid had returned and reclaimed
what they had left.  You felt like the last few months had been a happy,
escapist dream, and you were once again waking up to the cold reality of war.
<P>
Eventually word worked its way to you through the village that the Resistance
was reforming to combat the new Invid invasion, and that a group was gathering
in a remote area a hundred miles away.  You decided to leave your town and
rejoin the Resistance, as you felt your continued presence put your friends
and relatives in danger.  So you put on your CVR-3 body armor, slapped your
last few protoculture cells into your Cyclone, and went back into the war. 
You quickly found a Resistance group to join, and were surprised at how
quickly the skills and tactics of guerrilla warfare came back to you.  Despite
the initial shock and despair the Invid's return had caused, morale was very
high at first.  There seemed to be less Invid mecha around and fewer hives,
and those Invid you encountered followed the same dumb tactics they had in the
past, allowing you and your friends to outguess your enemy and pull off
several impressive raids, ambushes and counterattacks.  Things were going
well, but you couldn't shake the feeling in the back of your head that somehow
this was TOO easy, and that something more sinister was in the air.  Still,
you kept your thoughts to yourself as your Resistance group continued to try
to be a major thorn in the Invid's side.
<P>
Four years passed, and the early optimism of your group gave way to fatalism
and despair.  Although the Invid presence on Earth appeared smaller, none of
your strikes seemed to do any good.  No matter how many Invid you knocked out
in a raid or ambush, there always were more ready to take their place the next
day.  Also, new lights began appearing in the night sky.  Sparkling like stars
but moving too fast to be constellations, you deduced that they could only be
orbiting fortresses constructed by the Invid for some purpose which you could
not guess at.  The idea of a network of hives floating above the Earth made
you fidget nervously in your sleeping bag at night.  Meanwhile, more and more
of your friends were killed in action, while supplies and new recruits slowed
to a trickle.  
<P>

 SRC="./Images/fallensoldier.gif">
Worst of all were the stories that you were hearing, of entire towns and
cities wiped out or enslaved, and of more and more resistance groups being
captured or killed.  Even the famous <B><I>Rook's Knights</I></B>, led by war
heroes <B>Rook Bartley</B> and <B>Lancer</B>, were rumored to have been killed
in an ambush (or captured and mutated into hideous creatures, depending on
which version of the story you heard).  Plus there was an overwhelming feeling
of abandonment flowing through the Resistance.  Where was the REF?  Why
weren't they arriving in starships like they had in the past, with new
equipment, soldiers, and supplies to keep the resistance going?  Had the Invid
somehow destroyed Tirol and all the heroes like Rick and Lisa Hunter, Max and
Miriya Sterling, and others were all dead now?  Or had they decided that the
cost to retake Earth was too high, and abandoned the planet to Invid
domination?  The sparks of hope still existed among your group, but they were
growing fainter every day.
<P>
Then the war began to heat up again.  Finally, after long years of waiting the
REF once again returned, but not in the form of a huge space fleet this time. 
Instead, a small group of ships and men calling themselves the <B>REF Icarus
Recon Mission</B> arrived, with their goal being not to defend or liberate the
planet Earth, but instead to observe this new Invid force and eventually
report back to Tirol with their findings.  This put you off at first; why was
the REF wasting time with reconnaissance when people were dying here daily? 
Still, Icarus brought with it skilled troopers and technicians, as well as
much needed supplies in terms of protoculture cells, ammo, fuel, and new
mecha.  Most of all, Icarus brought much-needed hope to the Resistance.  It
proved to people that the REF at Tirol had survived, and were still trying to
help Earth in any way that they could.
<P>
But on the other hand, the Invid were undergoing a terrifying metamorphosis of
their own.  Most of the older Invid mecha that you had become so used to
fighting disappeared overnight, and in their place appeared devastatingly
powerful new designs, packed with enough weapons and firepower to easily
outclass the older mecha the Resistance was still using.  More sinister
however was the change in Invid tactics.  No longer did the Invid blindly
throw themselves into combat; instead they began to learn stealth and
subtlety, and surprised and wiped out several resistance groups with
well-planned diversionary attacks.  This new sneakiness shocked you and your
companions, giving you the strange feeling that someone NEW was leading the
Invid this time around.  However, events really started turning towards the
worst in late 2044, when your group received word that the Icarus fleet had
been destroyed in orbit by coordinated strikes from Invid Space Fortresses. 
It seemed as if the last hope for humanity's survival had just been snuffed
out by the unseen hands of the new Invid overlords.
<P>
Probably by now any sane man would have given up, thrown down their weapons
and prostrated themselves in front of the nearest Invid to beg for mercy. 
There seemed little point to fighting on against such overwhelming odds.  But
then you had a experience that reaffirmed your dedication to the Resistance. 
While on patrol one day, you discovered a dirty, wounded, scared little girl
all alone in the forest, trying desperately to hide in the brush.  The girl
was so exhausted that she collapsed in your arms without even telling you her
name.  You rushed her back to your camp where your medic cleaned her up, and
you were shocked to find that after the medic had cleaned the girl's face that
you recognized her!  She was from your home town, now hundreds of miles away! 
Feverish and in pain, the girl told you about how the Invid had marched into
your town and rounded up everyone there.  Any who resisted were killed
instantly.  Worse yet, the survivors were separated into those who could and
could not work, and the weak were exterminated while the strong watched.  Then
the slaves were led away in chains to farm protoculture for the Invid.  The
girl had escaped and fled the Invid and their frags, and by some miracle
managed to find you.  However, despite your medic's best efforts, the girl
gave into her wounds and exhaustion and died during the night.
<P>
The next morning you were a changed person.  Gone was the despair and
fatalism, and in its place was a grim determination that while you lived, you
would continue to fight so that humanity didn't simply pass into extinction as
Invid slave farm workers.  This you swore over the girl's grave, that you
would continue to fight until all young people like her were safe and free.
<P>
The arrival of your team's bio-mechanic at the campfire interrupts your grim
reminiscing.  He announces that he has finished repairing all the damage from
your last raid, and has used up the last of your group's surplus fuel and ammo
to restore the mecha to full operating capacity.  "Your mecha are ready to
rumble," he announces, "but there ain't no spares anymore so watch
yourselves."  Your group leader starts discussing possible targets to move
against in the next few days.  You flex your fingers as the faces of all the
friends and allies who have died before you flash through your mind, and then
you focus yourself on the plans your group is discussing.  Soon it will be
time to make the Invid pay for what they've done.
