When the Regis sent the <A HREF="./stage6invid.html">stage 6 Invid</A> to Earth 
she gave them instructions to hold the planet at <B>ANY</B> cost, ensuring that 
the vital supplies of the Flower of Life continued to flow to New Optera until
the new home of the Invid became self sufficient.  This gave the Leader Invid 
considerable latitude, and as the war continued they began to exploit this 
freedom to come up with crueler and more elaborate strategies.  At first the 
stage 6 Invid worked together, completely reworking the tactics and 
<A HREF="./newinvidmecha.html">mecha</A> of their forces, but as time continued 
they began to diverge and explore different ways to augment their personal forces.  
This led to the development of a number of <I>test weapons</I> by various stage 
6 Invid, which were deployed within their domains for field testing.  Some 
designs proved inadequate and were quickly withdrawn from service, while others 
were extremely effective and were eventually distributed all over the Earth.
<P>
A large concern among the stage 6 Invid was to find a way to augment their
limited forces.  Although the numbers of Invid on Earth during the Third
Invid War were higher than initially estimated by resistance fighters (around
5 million compared to early estimates of 2 million), Invid forces were still
spread fairly thin in some areas, especially considering the enormous amounts
of troops it took to operate the orbiting Invid Space Hives.  In order to 
ensure their domination of Earth and prevent interference with their mission,
the stage 6 Invid needed new soldiers to supplement their own forces on 
the Earth.
<P>
Independent stage 6 Invid came up with three different approaches to solving 
this problem.  The first was to actively recruit humans to work for the 
Invid in securing their planet.  The stage 6 Invid discovered that they could
quickly build up an army of followers with promises of supplies and 
preferential treatment, and that humans made very effective troops for 
maintaining order in towns and managing slave camps.  The Invid never really
trusted the humans working for them, however, and so always kept a wary eye
on them and used them only in positions of low importance.
<P>

Other stage 6 Invid tried to ressurect the Inorganic technology used by
the Regent during the First Invid War on Tirol and the Sentinels worlds.  
In some ways Inorganics were ideal for the type of warfare being conducted
on Earth; remote units that could be sent out into the field for weeks or
months (or years) at a time and wander around the countryside searching for
resistance fighters.  Inorganics were also used as heavy combat units, 
supplementing the <A HREF="./combattrooper.html">Combat Troopers</A> as the
first line of Invid offense.  The stage 6 Invid did improve on the technology,
however.  Unlike the Regent's mecha, the new Inorganics were completely 
independent and did not rely on Invid brains for direction and animation. 
Also, the Inorganics were designed and armed more for special-purpose 
missions rather than the older general-purpose Scrimm, Crann, and Odeon,
which tried to fulfill a number of roles and were successful in none.
<P>
Other stage 6 Invid moved along a darker path.  They realized that in a sense
they were literally sitting on top of a possible home-grown army; humanity
itself.  The Regis had for a time experimented in biological and cybernetic 
augmentation of humans, and the stage 6 Invid reopened that research with 
the goal of turning humans into useful tools for their purposes.  Some 
Invid tried to use cybernetic humans discreetly as spies or saboteurs, while
others tried to turn them into unfeeling workers or monstrous killing machines 
that could be used as disposable troops.  Fortunately the cybernetic experiments
were never widely distributed before the Third Invid War ended, but where 
they were used they caused widespread havoc among terran resistance forces.
Had the Third Invid War continued for a few more years humanity may have 
found itself in a civil war against helpless victim of the stage 6 Invid's
cruelty.
