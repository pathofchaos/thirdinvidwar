<A NAME="intro"><H2>INTRODUCTION</H2></A>
Research into creating a light, mobile assault mecha eventually 
evolved into two forms:  One was the Cyclone Series 4, which 
eventually became the VR series of Cyclone which was deployed 
with the REF to Tirol and then back to Earth.  The other was the 
Cyclone Series 5, a larger motorcycle which offered several 
advantages that the smaller form did not.  Due to technical 
design problems in the Series 5 prototype, the Series 4 became 
the eventual choice of the REF for their Tirol mission.
<P>
However, development on the Cyclone Series 5 continued, though it
took another direction.  By 2026, with the development of new 
advances in Robotechnology, the original design had been updated 
to produce a prototype Series 5 machine, code named Garland.  In 
order to allow rapid analysis and transfer of test data, this 
Garland was equipped with a special data terminal with direct 
access to the Robotech Research Center's mainframe computers.  
This terminal was referred to as the MODAT 5, for Mobile 
Operations Data Analysis Terminal (contained within a) Series 5 
(Cyclone).  This name was also used to refer to the Series 5 
Garland that contained the MODAT terminal.
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=288 HEIGHT=216 BORDER=2 SRC="/web/20131209231248im_/http://steelfalcon.com/Garland/Images/capture.gif">
Only one MODAT-equipped Garland prototype was produced.  It was 
stolen in 2027 by Todd Harris and passed on to his friend, Mark 
Landry, and it played a critical role in defending the earth from 
the first wave of the Robotech Masters' assault (though this 
incident was hushed up by Supreme Commander Leonard, "for reasons 
of morale").
<P>
During this period of time, Dr.s Zand and Beckett also 
experimented with reducing the costs of producing the Garland 
by separating some transformational components from the main 
body of the machine.  This improved the performance of the 
pseudo-Garland (called the Hargun) in motorcycle mode; however, 
the Hargun could not transform into its humanoid form unless a 
specially-equipped utility vehicle carrying the additional parts 
was nearby.  Interestingly enough, due to the disassembled nature 
of the Hargun's components, it could be incorporated into special 
aerial hover platforms for rapid deployment and transportation.  
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=288 HEIGHT=381 SRC="/web/20131209231248im_/http://steelfalcon.com/Garland/Images/hargun.gif">
The Hargun was discontinued after a short time, but the lessons 
learned through this experimentation enabled Zand to construct 
several improved versions of the Garland motorcycle.  Two of 
these modified Garland models (Series 6 and 7) saw service in the 
Monument City police force for a short period of time.  Though 
eventually retired as "unneeded and unfeasible," while they were 
in service the Garland 6 and 7 had an almost unmatched record.  
GMP officers swore by them.  
<P>
It is interesting to note that forty of the approximately five 
hundred Garlands and ten of the one hundred Harguns placed in 
storage mysteriously vanished from the military compound where 
they were stored from June 2031 to January 2032, and were 
eventually seen in the hands of one of the many motorcycle gangs 
that sprang up in the wake of the Robotech Masters' defeat.  The 
rest were scattered; some went to Africa Base, some went to other 
bases and outposts, but the majority (about 300) were stored in a 
deep bunker (a "Small REF Base," REF FIELD GUIDE pg. 48-52) 
somewhere in South America.
<P>
There are rumors of a highly-developed later version of the 
Garland, the Garland 8.  This bike was said to have a 
highly-developed cybernetic interface system for greatly-improved 
performance.  It would mount some additional weapon systems, 
including two vibroblade daggers and an experimental version of 
the mini-missile launchers that had been incorporated into the 
forearms of the VR-052 Battler Cyclone.  It is rumored that ten 
of these bikes were manufactured before the fall of the United 
Earth Government.  Where they may be stored is unknown (although 
the Robotech Research Center itself is the most likely 
possibility).
<P>
The Garland is a wonderful little machine.  It has a powerful
engine, combined with triple turbo thrusters in back for limited
flight, and a remarkable array of available weapons.

 We didn't actually get to drive this model, as it was destroyed 
 in a warehouse fire two years ago.  We've heard from the 
 scientists and test pilots who helped create it that the Garland 
 was almost exactly like the Garland 6 is, but with a more 
 primitive engine and a high-tech computer communication terminal 
 (so high-tech that no one will talk to us about exactly what it 
 did!).  The pictures we've been shown LOOK almost exactly like 
 the Garland 6 we got to drive, with minor exceptions such as 
 fairing shape, et cetera.  Its color was a bright red in the 
 only color drawing; however the only colors used in this drawing 
 were red, black, gray, and white, so we can't really tell if 
 that's what it's supposed to be.

<B>The Garland 6</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 The handling on this motorcycle compares favorably with most
 motorcycles on the civilian market.  It features amazing
 cornering, and can attain remarkable speeds.  Our former ATACS
 Hovertank pilot put it through its paces, and afterward had a
 great deal to say about it.  He pointed out the computer
 terminal which resembles those found in police cars of the late
 20th century, which the police used for calling up the criminal
 records of their arrestees.  He mentioned the net-gun and
 magnetic cables, "for taking them alive."  Furthermore, he
 indicated the stunning maneuverability of the machine--it has 
 more speed and better handling than any other ground mecha, 
 except possibly the prototype "Cyclone Cycle" that the REF took 
 with them 8 years ago.  And this machine has an amazing capacity 
 for taking damage.  All in all, it's a surprise that it isn't 
 serving in the front lines.

<B>The Garland 7</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 This machine is the newest of the Garland line, and also the 
 fastest.  It gets a good 50 mph better than the Garland 5 or 6, 
 because it rides on jets of air instead of tires.  It is also 
 even more maneuverable than the Garland 6.  However, because it 
 flies instead of drives, it's just a bit harder to control.  But 
 according to our pilot, once you get used to it, it's "like 
 flying a dream."  The GMP pilot told us, "You wouldn't believe 
 how much of a help it is to us in high-speed chases."

 We didn't actually get to drive this one, but we saw plenty of 
 footage of it in action.  It used to fill the roles now occupied 
 by the Garland 6 and 7--a transformable high-speed pursuit and 
 assault vehicle (the motorcycle Hargun), and a transformable 
 high-speed hovercraft (the hovercraft Hargun). By all reports, 
 over a hundred of these vehicles have been placed in storage, 
 awaiting disassembly for replacement parts or some other fate.
